## [85.8193.33] - 2021-09-30

Greetings from the Neverwinter Nights team!

We're pushing Build 85.8193.33 to the live branch!

### Patch notes

- Fixed local multiplayer failing with error 110622
- Fixed a crash when some PLT textures failed to load
- Fixed area tile source lights showing up as red when they previously were off after a game save & load
- Fixed some pathfinding regressions where creatures had difficulties leaving corridors/rooms
- Fixed a crash in the GetPlayerDeviceProperty script call when passing in an invalid player object
- Updated Steam SDK to version 152. This should fix the Mac M1 build not running natively when launched from Steam
- Added a message box when the user directory fails to initialise (instead of crashing). This is most commonly caused by Antivirus preventing write access to the Documents directory

This will be the last stable patch in a while! We want to thank you all again for your continued feedback!
