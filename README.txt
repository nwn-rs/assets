If you have trouble running the game on Linux, please see Linux_README.txt.

Your user directory:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=

You've installed this game through the Beamdog Client or Steam, and it created
a folder where the core game will be stored (you can find this out within
the Beamdog Client by clicking on Options/Open Game Location or looking under
Properties / Local Files in Steam).  This is intended to be a read-only
directory that contains the core game and any purchased downloadable content.
All of your data for the game should be installed, modified and backed up in
the user folder:

[My Documents]\Neverwinter Nights (Windows)
~/Documents/Neverwinter Nights (macOS)
~/.local/share/Neverwinter Nights (Linux)

Please make sure you have enough room on that device for the files that
you want to install.

We intend on continuing to modify the core game and DLC content in the future.
An update of the core game will not touch your user folder.

The game will install your personal CD key (which is new and unique to the
Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition) for use in multiplayer.  If you have
purchased the game through Steam, you will be allocated a Steam key the first
time you enter the Multiplayer menu.  If you have purchased the game on
Beamdog, the key is provided and written for you when you launch the game
through the Beamdog Client.

If you are using a public machine, you should ensure that your user directory
is removed safely before you leave it.

Your assigned CD key is your multiplayer Identity, and if given to third parties,
can be used to impersonate you on any online servers you play.
DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE.
