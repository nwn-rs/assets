ini file setting additions/changes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file settings, so that red/green color blind users don't get killed by traps unexpectedly.
    [Trap Colors]
    FriendlyColor=0,255,0
    HostileColor=255,0,0
- Added ability to turn off visible cloaks in the nwnplayer.ini file (set to 1 to enable cloaks, 0 for no visible cloaks).
    [Game Options]
    Visible Cloaks=1
- Added in-game text swear filter nwnplayer.ini setting (set to 1 to enable, only supports English).
    [Game Options]
    In-game Text Swear Filter=0
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file setting to always roll maximum hit points at level up for players (defaults to off).
    [Server Options]
    Max Hit Points=1
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file setting to not display the hit points rolled on the level up summary gui (defaults to off).
    [Server Options]
    Hide Hit Points Gained=0
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file setting to restore the remaining spell uses from the character file on log in to a "server vault" server. This option defaults to off.
    [Server Options]
    Restore Spell Uses On Login=0
- Added new nwn.ini file setting to set how far into the distance grass should be rendered (default value 900.0, valid values range from 900.0 to 30000.0).  Increasing this value will cause more grass to be rendered in outdoor grassy areas, but will also reduce game performance in these areas.
    [Video Options]
    Grass Far Render Distance=900.0
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file setting to toggle on/off the file logging of creature deaths.
    [Game Options]
    Death Logging=0
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file setting to reset the encounter level spawned by an encounter trigger every time that it spawns creatures. If this option is turned on, the encounter trigger will always spawn creatures based on the triggering player's level rather than potentially using left over spawned creature from an early triggering that was initiated by a much higher level player.
    [Server Options]
    Always Reset Encounter Spawns=0
- Updated Get2DAString() scripting command 2da caching code to cache a number of 2das specified in an ini setting. 
    [Server Options]
    2DA Cache Size=10
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file setting to log each script as it executes (defaults to off). Enabling this will degrade game performance. It should only be used for script debugging purposes (i.e. when you have a bad script that causes your module to lock up, checking the log file will let you know the last script that executed).
    [Script Options]
    Enable Logging=1
- Added new nwnplayer.ini file setting to obtain script profiling data in the log file (defaults to off). Enabling this will degrade game performance. It should only be used to determine which scripts you need to optimize to improve the performance of your module. Note: "Enable Logging" should be turned off when profiling is enabled.
    [Script Options]
    Enable Profiling=1
- Added new option to the nwtoolset.ini file to set the toolset CPU affinity on multi-core computers. If you have more than one CPU on your PC, then you can use this setting to make the toolset run on only one of the CPUs by specifying the number of the CPU (0-31). Setting "CPU Affinity=-1" will turn off CPU affinity (default 0).
    [Start Up]
    "CPU Affinity".
- The nwnplayer.ini setting for "Client CPU Affinity" now defaults to 0 (a setting of -1 will be converted to 0). If you need to disable this feature set the value to -2.

- Fixes to Whirlwind/Improved Whirlwind/Great Cleave so that all the attacks are done at the player's full BAB.
- The Defensive Roll feat now works 1/day as per the description.

- Fixed issue with resting not getting canceled correctly if a member of your party started attacking something during your rest period (the OnPlayerRest event is now properly called in this situation).

	GetSkillRank(int nSkill, object oTarget=OBJECT_SELF, int nBaseSkillRank=FALSE)

    GetName(object oObject, int bOriginalName=FALSE)
    ActionRest(int bCreatureToEnemyLineOfSightCheck=FALSE)
	RandomName(int nNameType=NAME_FIRST_GENERIC_MALE)
- Added a new OnClick event type for placeables. This event fires immediately when a PC left clicks on a placeable (regardless of how far away they are from the placeable, or whether or not they can reach the placeable for whatever reason).
  To obtain the player that left clicked on the placeable object, call GetPlaceableLastClickedBy() in the placeable's OnClick script.
- Added 53 new VFX_DUR_AURA_* visual effects (VisualEffects.2da) for use with the scripting command EffectVisualEffect().
- Added 80 new visual effect constants (VisualEffects.2da) for use with the scripting command EffectVisualEffect(). These use the new constants VFX_DUR_AURA_*, VFX_EYES_* and VFX_DUR_BUBBLES. 
- Added new FOOTSTEP_TYPE_* constants to nwscript.nss (FootstepSounds.2da)
- Added the ability to force a placeable to be non-static (grey out the static checkbox) for any placeable using skin mesh. This is toggleable in the placeables.2da in a "Static" column. Defaults to allow if column missing.
- Added Hook Hands and Peg Leg armor appearance variations to the toolset.
- Added new Trident weapon models to the toolset under Polearms (x2_inc_itemprop.nss, x0_i0_match.nss). There are no new Trident specific weapon feats associated with Tridents at this time (BaseItems.2da).
- Added a new Shipwreck group to the desert tileset.
- Added 4 new groups to the city exterior tileset (Merchant Ship and Weather Ship variations).
- Added option to skip multiple hak pak warning message to the nwtoolset.ini file "Display Hak Warning=1"
- The scripting command GetResRef() now works on areas, stores and waypoints.
- The scripting command PlayAnimation() now works on doors (use the new animation constants ANIMATION_DOOR_*).
- The scripting command GetClassByPosition() will now work with community made custom classes.
- Made the scripting command CopyItemAndModify() work with arrows and bolts using the constants ITEM_APPR_TYPE_WEAPON_*
- Added random facing button to the toolset.  This button allows you to select one or more things and change their facing to a random direction.
- Added option to skip multiple hak pak warning message to the nwtoolset.ini file, section [Start Up], "Display Hak Warning=1"
- Fixed crashes caused by passing in invalid area/module objects to the scripting commands SetListenPattern() and GetMatchedSubstring() (or running these from an area/module event).
- Fixed scripting command ItemPropertyImmunityToSpellLevel(), it was creating a spell immunity property that was one level lower than what it should have been creating.
- Fixed a typo in the constant name IP_CONST_FEAT_USE_POISON. If you recompile a script that uses the old name, you will need to update your script to use the new fixed name.
- Fixed a typo in the constant name FOOTSTEP_TYPE_SOFT. If you recompile a script that uses the old name, you will need to update your script to use the new fixed name.
- Fixed an issue with the incorrect door type showing up for the "Turfhouse Interior 2x2" in the Ruins tileset (tdr01.set). 
- Fixed an issue with no door showing up for the "Cloak Tower 2x2" in the Rural Winter tileset (tts01.set). 
- Fixed an issue with the door being rotated for the "Turf House 2" in the Rural Winter tileset (tts01.set). 
- Fixed the Rural Tileset - Wall 2 Gate w/Road model for people that have HotU installed.
- Fixed a visual issue with the campfire placeable (plc_i06.mdl).
- Fixed the level up wizard duplicating Special Abilities from the Creature Properties window.

Scripting-specific:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Added new TileMagic functions in x2_inc_toollib.nss that make use of GetAreaSize:
    void TLResetAreaGroundTilesEx(object oArea);
	void TLChangeAreaGroundTilesEx(object oArea, int nGroundTileConst, float fZOffset = -0.4f );
- Added a new Creature name randomization feature to the default OnSpawn script ("nw_c2_default9.nss")
  By setting a new variable int X2_NAME_RANDOM to 1 on a creature template in the toolset, the module creature
  can now tell creatures to randomize their name on Spawn. By default this will cause the creature to change it's name to
  a name generated by the RandomName command.
  For module builders not satisfied with the name selection provided by the RandomName command, the ability
  to override this behavior with a random name generation script of their choice has been included: 
  If a script called "x3_name_gen.nss" exists in a module, it will be executed on spawn of any creature template that has 
  random name generation activated. The builder can then specify a return value for that custom name generation script by
  setting a string variable named "X3_S_RANDOM_NAME" on OBJECT_SELF (the creature spawning), which will then be used 
  instead of RandomName().
- Made Web Bolt attacks respect the Woodland stride feat (nw_s1_bltweb.nss).
- Fixed a typo in the impact script name for "Greater Fox's Cunning" in the spells.2da that was causing the spell to not work.
- Changed implosion so that it no longer affects the caster (nw_s0_implosion.nss).
- Changed the way the damage was being calculated for the shifter's various wyrmling and dragon breath attacks to make it more random (x2_s1_wyrmbreath.nss, x2_s2_edragbrth.nss).
- Fixed an issue with the way the reflex saving throw was being done in DoMissileStorm() (x0_i0_spells.nss).
- Fixed an issue with Cloud of Bewilderment not respecting poison immunity (x2_s0_cldbewlda.nss, x2_s0_cldbewldc.nss).
- Finger of Death now properly respects immunity to death magic on a failed save (NW_S0_FingDeath.NSS).
- Fixed a bug with MatchSingleHandedWeapon and MatchDoubleHandedWeapon returning the incorrect value for some weapon types (x0_i0_match.nss)
- Mass Blindness/Deafness now only affects enemies even on the harder difficulty settings (nw_s0_massbldf.nss). 

Custom Content:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Change to allow plt texture support on custom created part based creature races. Part based creatures (past row 481 in the appearance.2da) will now use a plt texture name based on the "RACE" letter specified in the appearance.2da (rather than always using the pfh0_ prefix). If your custom part based creature is past row 481 in the appearance.2da and you haven't specified the race specific PLT texture the game will use the human PLT texture by default.
- Fixed an issue with how the caster level was being calculated for classes that used the ArcSpellLvlMod and DivSpellLvlMod values in the classes.2da (for values other than 2).
- Added custom grass texture support to the tileset set file. The new grass texture entry is "GrassTextureName". For example specifying the following in the set file:
	[GRASS] 
	Grass=1 
	GrassTextureName=my_grass
  Will cause "my_grass.tga" (maximum of 16 characters and do not include the .tga extension in the name) to be used as the grass texture for the tileset. The game will default to the usual "grass.tga" if "GrassTextureName" is not specified.
- Fixed an issue where new names added to the SavingThrowTable column in the classes.2da were causing the toolset to behave erratically.
- Added support for prestige class prerequisite type "SAVE" (used in the CLS_PRES_*.2da files).
	 ReqParam1           ReqParam2
	 1 = Fort Save       Minimum Base Save Required
	 2 = Ref Save        Minimum Base Save Required
	 3 = Will Save       Minimum Base Save Required
- Note to custom tilelset makers: When creating custom tilsets, don't forget to create a corresponding entry for the new tileset in the areag.ini file.  The "Interior" flag must match that from the .set file created.
- Updated the DefaultIcon column of the BaseItems.2da to have new entries. This fixes an issue with taking hak pak specific items into a non-hak pak module which in turn was causing your inventory to start behaving erratically.
- Changed the behavior of in game Robe inventory icons. The icon will now also display non-hidden body parts as specified in the parts_robe.2da (the icon will only display the robe, pelvis, belt, torso and shoulders). 
- Added a new "DefaultPhenoType" column to the phenotype.2da. The number specified in this column will be the phenotype that will be used in the case where the model does not exist for the desired phenotype (e.g. when using the SetPhenoType() scripting command).
- Made Head models use the same "DefaultPhenoType" system as above (rather than your head just disappearing if the model didn't exist for the desired phenotype).
- Wings/Tails will now use PLT textures if they exist (defaulting to using the creature's skin color), if a PLT texture does not exist for the model then the texture will default to using the TGA instead.

Patch details for 1.66:
Neverwinter Nights Game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
WARNING! AS OF THIS PATCH, ALL MODULES CREATED/SAVED WITH THE VERSION 1.66 TOOLSET ARE TAGGED AS REQUIRING VERSION 1.66 OR HIGHER OF NEVERWINTER NIGHTS GAME OR TOOLSET.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BRAND YOUR MODULE AS 1.66 THEN DO NOT EDIT YOUR MODULE IN THE VERSION 1.66 TOOLSET.
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO 1.65, WE WILL HAVE A 1.66 TO 1.65 PATCH AVAILABLE.
- Official Campaign: Chapter 2E  - Made Voleron's OnDeath script a bit more robust.
- HotU: Chapter 2 - Fixed an issue that could sometimes occur during the battle in the Environs near the end of Chapter 2. You should no longer get stuck and be unable to move if the Battle Herald does not approach you and initiate a conversation with you (this fix will retroactively fix saved games exhibiting this issue, but only if you load a saved game from before you entered the Environs).
- Added a new command line parameter for automatically loading a module in single player. This will cause the module to be loaded and takes the player to the premade character select screen.
    +LoadNewModule "module name that needs quotes if it contains spaces"
- Added a new command line parameter for automatically testing a module in single player. This will cause the module to be loaded and then starts the module using the first character listed on the premade character select screen.
    +TestNewModule "module name that needs quotes if it contains spaces"
- Added 3 portraits and 3 music themes from the BioWare Premium Modules Kingmaker, ShadowGuard, and Witch's Wake 1 to game resources.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the game to slow down and become unplayable at the start of SoU Chapter 2.
- Fixed an issue with creatures some times occupying the same space.  This should happen a lot less frequently now.
- Extended the glowing monk eye effect to work on all the default playable races. 
- Neutral monks now get ultra cool purple glowing eyes.
- Fixed placement of glowing monk eyes on Human/Half-Elf females (much thanks to the DLA team for their help with this).
- Fixed placement of helmets on Human/Half-Elf females (much thanks to the DLA team for their help with this).
- Added server support for the ability to refuse player login attempts if the master server could not be reached. In the nwnplayer.ini files under the heading [Server Options] set the follwowing option to '1' "Master Server Authentication Required For Player Login=1"
- Added the ability to turn on/off the Heartbeat logging in the log file (default is now off). In the nwnplayer.ini file under [Game Options] set "Heartbeat Logging=1" in order to turn the Heartbeat logging back on.
- Added a new nwnplayer.ini setting to have the server do some spell validation for spells cast by players. Under [Server Options] set "Validate Spells=1". Note: If you are using an edited spells.2da that is only being used server side, you may want to disable this option if your players are finding that they can't cast certain spells anymore (the log file should indicated if this is happening). 
- Added new option to the nwnplayer.ini file under [Server Options] "Account validation required during Master Server down times=1" If this option is turned on, the server will track the public CD-Keys of each player logging onto the server. If the Master Server ever goes down for any reason (e.g. for scheduled maintenance) then the server will validate itself that the player name of any new player trying to connect is in fact using the same public cd-key that they last logged in with.
- Fixed an issue with the Greater Sanctuary icon some times incorrectly showing up as the regular Sanctuary icon.
- Fixed an issue with Damage Immunities not working correctly once they were stacked way too high above 100%.

- The "Single Player Enforce Legal Characters" setting in the nwnplayer.ini file has been disabled. ELC is now always turned off in single player games.
- Fixed an issue that was causing creatures to always face east when sitting on a stool placeable (plc_x05.pwk).
- Fixed another issue where under specific circumstances items would not show up in your inventory panel.
- Immunity to mind spells no longer makes you immune to the Assasin's Death Attack.
- Sneak/Death attacks now properly respect the Pale Master's Deathless Mastery feat.
- Fixed a minor animation issue that could occur if you performed a Whirlwind attack while you had some 2 handed weapons equipped.
- Fixed some issues with Tile "time of day" animations. This was causing flickering and other issues at the end of a DayToNight/NightToDay transition.
- Fixed an issue with the Force Field door sounds using the default wooden door sounds (placeableobjsnds.2da, genericdoors.2DA).
- Fixed an issue related to copying a creature from a hak pak through scripting and then saving and loading the hak pak saved game from inside gameplay (was causing some different weird issues).
- Added support for WeaponType 5 (Bludgeoning and Piercing) in the BaseItems.2da.
- Updated Morningstars to use the new Bludgeoning and Piercing WeaponType (BaseItems.2da).

- Added missing armor proficiency to Gnolls.
- Made some fixes to prevent game/character hacking. Sorry, but we will never publicly discuss specific changes to the game with regards to hacking the game.

DM Client:
=-=-=-=-=-
- DMs can now still login to a server when the server is full, so that they are not prevented from performing any required administration tasks. If you go above the 64 player maximum, server performance may be adversely affected until some players leave the server (your mileage may vary).
- The game no longer displays encumbered feedback messages for DMs, since they actually can't ever be encumbered.

Neverwinter Nights Aurora Toolset:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Added two new item scripting commands GetPickpocketableFlag() and SetPickpocketableFlag().
- Added a "Test Module" option to the toolset's Build menu that allows you to quick launch the game (for testing module changes). Selecting this option will give you the choice of saving your module changes. The game will then automatically launch, load the module, select the first available premade character in the list and enter gameplay with that character. The Hot Key for this new functionality is F9.
- Fixed an error that was causing some of the Group "Home Lower/Upper" tiles in the city interior tileset to appear as duplicates of some of the other "Home" tiles (tinpalstd.itp). This change makes some new "Home" tile types available for placing in the toolset.
- Fixed an issue with answering no to any warnings that appear during module opening causing any subsequently opened module to potentially become corrupt.
- Fixed comments for the scripting commands EffectSavingThrowIncrease and EffectSavingThrowDecrease (nwscript.nss).
- The GetIsImmune() scripting command now reports the proper result when the creature specified has the Pale Master's Deathless Mastery feat.

- Added some missing IP_CONST_FEAT_* constants to nwscript.nss
- Fixed a Copy area/script/dialog issue that was making it look like the toolset was loosing data and could sometimes lead to a crash.
- Fixed an issue with the script compiler that could cause a Stack Underflow error when a switch statement was placed inside a Do/While loop. There is also a new command line compiler in the Neverwinter Nights utils directory that includes this fix (clcompile.exe).
- Fixed an issue with the scripting command GetCasterLevel() when used from within a feat script for a feat that was granted at first level (e.g. Cleric Protection Domain Powers).
- Added two new creature related scripting commands GetFootstepType() and SetFootstepType().
- Fixed an issue related to using the scripting command CopyObject() on a player's associate.

Script Debugger:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
- Fixed a compiler issue that was causing the script debugger (DebugServer.exe that is in your NWN utils directory) to not work properly when stepping into/out of case statements (see the scripting command SpawnScriptDebugger() for more information regarding the script debugger).

Server-specific:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
- Added server support for the ability to refuse player login attempts if the master server could not be reached. In the nwnplayer.ini files under the heading [Server Options] set the follwowing option to '1' "Master Server Authentication Required For Player Login=1"
- Added the ability to turn on/off the Heartbeat logging in the log file (default is now off). In the nwnplayer.ini file under [Game Options] set "Heartbeat Logging=1" in order to turn the Heartbeat logging back on.
- Added a new nwnplayer.ini setting to have the server do some spell validation for spells cast by players. Under [Server Options] set "Validate Spells=1". Note: If you are using an edited spells.2da that is only being used server side, you may want to disable this option if your players are finding that they can't cast certain spells anymore (the log file should indicated if this is happening). 
- Added new option to the nwnplayer.ini file under [Server Options] "Account validation required during Master Server down times=1" If this option is turned on, the server will track the public CD-Keys of each player logging onto the server. If the Master Server ever goes down for any reason (e.g. for scheduled maintenance) then the server will validate itself that the player name of any new player trying to connect is in fact using the same public cd-key that they last logged in with.

Scripting-specific:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Made Invisibility Purge work correctly with Invisibility that is granted through special abilities such as the Assasin's Invisibility (NW_S0_InvPurgeA.NSS).
- Fixed an issue with Wail of the Banshee sometimes requiring the first target to make two saving throws instead of one (nw_s0_wailbansh.nss).
- Implosion now properly ignores immunity to death magic (nw_s0_implosion.nss).
- Fixed the maximized damage healed for cure spells (nw_i0_spells.nss)
- Cure spells now do DAMAGE_TYPE_POSITIVE to undead rather than DAMAGE_TYPE_NEGATIVE (nw_i0_spells.nss).
- Phantasmal Killer now properly respects Fear immunity and properly ignores Death Magic immunity (nw_s0_phankill.nss).
- Weird now properly ignores Death Magic immunity (nw_s0_weird.nss).
- Mind fog now properly respects immunity to mind affecting spells (nw_s0_mindfoga.nss).
- The item properties "Immunity: Specific Spell [Gaze Petrification/Touch Petrification/Breath Petrification]" now work properly against monster petrification effects (x0_i0_spells.nss).
- Fixed an issue with Choking Powder heart beat script not repecting poison immunity ( x0_s3_chokehb.nss ).
- Fixed an issue with the way the damage calculation was being done for the Cone of Frost monster ability (nw_s1_conecold.nss).
- Made the Shifter's Manticore's spike script work correctly in the case when it is inappropriately given to an NPC Manticore monster by mistake (x2_s1_gwspikes.nss).
- Fix to Negative Energy Ray, to properly calculate the damage for a successul saving throw (nw_s0_negray.nss).
- Fixed the extended duration for Divine Favor (x0_s0_divfav.nss).
- Made a change to the Wyrmling Breath, Dragon Breath and Petrifying Gaze attacks used by some of the Shifter shapes. Previously if you targeted yourself with one of these attacks the cone attack would damage creatures East from your location, it will now be directed forwards from your character instead. (x2_s2_edragbrth.nss, x2_s1_wyrmbreath.nss, x2_s1_petrgaze.nss).
- Made the same above fix for the RDD dragon breath ability (x2_s2_discbreath).
- Updated the duration of "Camouflage/Mass Camouflage" to bring these spells more inline with 3rd edition rules (x0_i0_spells.nss, x0_s0_masscamo.nss). Also updated the in game spell descriptions to reflect the change.

Custom Content:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Added a new column to the feat.2da "ReqAction" (all default NWN feats have this value set to 1 and if the column is missing from the feats.2da, such as in a hak pak, it will also default to 1). Turning this off means that the adjusted feat will no longer require an action from the object (it fires immediately, takes no action, and ignores your action queue entirely). In order to use this new functionality you need to do the following: 
  1) Set the "ReqAction" value for the feat to 0 in the feat.2da
  2) Have a spellID associated with the feat in the feat.2da.
  3) Have a "ImpactScript" specified in the spells.2da for the spellID that you specified in the feat.2da
  The ImpactScript will then fire immediately when the feat is used. 
- Walk meshes now work when placed at heights above -30 (previous lower limit was -10).
- Added an option to change/increase the selector height (when placing tiles) in the tileset "set" file. In order to use this you must add a new setting called "SelectorHeight" to the set file and specify the desired float value for this setting. The selector height will continue to default to the transition height if it has not been specified.
- Added more tile path nodes types m, n, o, and p. For custom tile set support. 

TYPE m				TYPE n
    ---------           --------- 
    [ | | | ]           [ | | | ] 
    [-+ | +-]           [-+ + +-]

- Whirlwind attack will no longer leave you stuck in combat mode after using it. You will now also try to reaquire your original target after a Whirlwind attack (may not succeed if your target is now dead or gone).
- Damage Shields (e.g. Mestil's Acid Sheath ) now affect the melee attacker when the attacker hits the creature that has a damage shield (rather than only when they damage the shielded creature).

If you recompile any scripts that use these scripting commands, you will need to update your scripts to use the new (proper) functionality.
- Fixed an issue with GetSpellSaveDC() returning the DC of any new spell cast (or feat used) by the creator of an AOE spell when called from within the AOE's heartbeat script (rather than returning the DC of the originally cast AOE spell).
- Extended the scripting command EffectHeal(), so that it now also works on doors and placeables.
- Fixed a couple of issues with the ResistSpell() scripting command:
    - First issue occurred when it was called from within an AOE heart beat script after the caster had cast a new spell since casting the original AOE spell, the AOE spell could stop working under these conditions (it should now work properly).
    - Second issue was with the spell immunity check not returning the proper result when called with the caster object specified as an AOE object.

Patch details for 1.64:
Neverwinter Nights Game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
WARNING! AS OF THIS PATCH, ALL MODULES CREATED/SAVED WITH THE VERSION 1.64 TOOLSET ARE TAGGED AS REQUIRING VERSION 1.64 OR HIGHER OF NEVERWINTER NIGHTS GAME OR TOOLSET.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BRAND YOUR MODULE AS 1.64 THEN DO NOT EDIT YOUR MODULE IN THE VERSION 1.64 TOOLSET.
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO 1.62, WE WILL HAVE A 1.64 TO 1.62 PATCH AVAILABLE.
- Original Campaign: Fixed an issue with Sharwyn not using her Bard Song ability (this should not affect Sharwyn in HotU).
- Original Campaign: Chapter 2 - The scene at the Pinnacle of the Host Tower should now always fire properly, no matter what.
- Original Campaign: Chapter 2 - Lenton isn't as busy as he used to be (you can now talk to him again).
- Original Campaign: Prelude - Fixed a minor error that could occur under specific circumstances when opening a certain chest.
- HotU: Chapter 2 - Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash when specific spells were active in the Wizard's Tower in Shaori's fell.
- HotU: Chapter 2 - Fixed an issue with the teleporter to the Grand Hall in Zorvak'Mur, as it wasn't working properly under a specific set of circumstances.
- HotU: Chapter 3 - Fix to a rare bug in the Windswept Battlefield area where the 'boss' creature wouldn't spawn in properly, which made him somewhat difficult to kill.
- HotU: Chapter 3 - When the game ends, we now remove the non-droppable (cursed) flag from all items before doing the final export of the character. This is so that when you take the character into another module, you can drop items such as the Relic of the Reaper.
  - If you already have a character who can't get rid of the Relic (or another item), you can do the following (in single player) - in the chat bar, type:
      ##DebugMode 1
      ##runscript nw_itemreset
      ##DebugMode 0
  - If you use this script so that you can drop an item which is part of the module you're currently playing, don't be surprised if the game breaks later on (because the module will expect you to have the item). Only use it to get rid of items that have been stuck to your character from other modules.
- Made some fixes to prevent game/character hacking. Sorry, but we will never publicly discuss specific changes to the game with regards to hacking the game.
- Added a new ini setting to nwnplayer.ini [Server Options] "Saving Throw Automatic Failure On 1=1". If turned off (0), you will no long fail saving throws on a roll of 1 if your total saving throw with bonuses beats the required DC.
- Added a new Sub Net Profiling system (which logs bandwidth usage). To activate it, go to nwn.ini and in the [Game Options] section add in "Enable SubNet Profiling=1". A log file called SubNetProfile.log will be created in your root Neverwinter Nights directory once the game/server shuts down.
- Added new "Max Memory Usage" ini setting to [Game Options] in the nwnplayer.ini file. This allows you to set the amount of available memory (in Megs) that the game will use for caching resources in memory. Adding more memory for the cache may improve performance up to a point, after which increasing the cache size any more most likely wont do much. Your mileage may vary.
- Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash under certain circumstances when the player entered cutscene mode while their character was able to level up.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the "Greater Shadow Conjuration Web" spell to have a DC of 127. Should also fix the DC for other spells that also appear on a sub-radial menu.
- Fixed problem with shifters losing their merged item properties while in shifted form after a server save occurred, and when switching directly from one form to another using the radial menu.
- Fixed a problem where unpolymorphing could sometimes leave you walking around just fine while you have zero or less hit points.
- Fixed a bug that could cause some visual effects to be displayed on your character forever. Most often reported occurrence of this problem was the green paint effect from the goblin archers in the HotU official campaign.
- Fixed some other issues that could cause effects to not be removed properly from a creature.
- Fixed some issues with the Red Dragon Disciple not getting the proper hit die rolled at level up.
- Fixed problem with characters becoming illegal if they multiclassed to a wizard, but their intelligence was too low to even cast cantrips.
- Devastating Critical now works with bows.
- Fixed a problem with the PaleMaster's Deathless Vigor feat not always giving the correct hit points.
- Fixed a issue with the hit points displayed on the level-up summary screen if you just took the toughness feat during your level-up.
- Fixed the dispel magic text message feedback. It wasn't always displaying the correct spell names.
- Fixed a problem where some quickbar tooltips were not getting cleared properly when the quickslot became empty.
- The familiar selection screen will no longer display the familiar's current hit points at 0 all the time.
- The game no longer displays the "Experience Points Gained:" message when the experience points gained was 0.
- Lootable corpses wont be stripped of items until after the corpse has been looted by a player.
- Fixed a problem with the wrong message being displayed if you tried to load a module that required one of the expansions packs to use and you didn't have the required expansion pack installed.
- Fixed a problem with the experience point penalty not always being calculated properly for multiclass characters that had taken a prestige class.
- Fixed a problem with custom portraits showing up on your party bar as a white box until the player using the portrait entered the same area as you.
- Fixed a problem with Whirlwind Attack data sometimes being incorrectly sent to players in other areas.
- Fixed a problem with the Age/Deity information getting lost when you edited an existing character using the "Customize Character" feature.
- EffectDispelMagicBest() now takes into account the level of the creator of the spell that it is trying to dispel, for determining whether the spell is actually dispelled successfully or not.
- Fixed item properties "Immunity: Damage Type Positive Energy" and "Immunity: Damage Type Negative Energy"
- Fixed issue, where if you lost a level and no longer had the required level for an item that you had equipped, your character would become illegal. The item is now unequipped automatically if you don't have the level required to equip it after losing a level.
- Fixed an issue with non-hostile actions (e.g. rest) getting canceled when someone joins your party. Made some changes so that not all hostile actions (i.e. attacks and spells) get canceled when a someone joins your party.  Some hostile actions will still be canceled when someone joins your party (and all attack/spells actions directed against other players) which is the intentional behavior.
- Fixed a problem with the OnStoreClosed scripts not working in saved games.
- Fixed a couple of problems that could make your inventory items disappear when opening your inventory. One was related to having a placeable container open and then bringing up other panels (e.g. your spell book) that caused your inventory panel to close. The second involved possessing/unpossessing a familiar while your inventory was open. Hopefully that's the last of the disappearing inventory problems.
- Fixed a problem where if you saved and reloaded a game while in defensive stance, you could no longer move.
- Fixed a problem with the remaining number of feat uses for some prestige classes not being calculated correctly when loading a saved game.
- The Epic Fire Trap item in the standard item palette now has the correct icon.
- Fixed some saving throw text feedback weirdness with some "On Hit" item properties. Affects Slay Racial Group, Slay Alignment, and Slay Alignment Group item properties.
- Fixed an issue where clicking "Cancel" in the game options menu wouldn't properly restore your orignal "Hide Secondary Story Tiles" setting.
- Fixed some issues with head turning. Creatures will no longer turn their heads to look at cutscene invisible players. After going through an area transition, NPCs will now still turn their heads to look at players.
- Fixed crash caused by calling TriggerProjectileTrap() with SPELL_MELFS_ACID_ARROW specified and oOrigin was a static placeable object.
- Fixed a problem where clients wouldn't play the spell casting sound if the character casting the spell had the Automatic Silent feat, regardless of the level of the spell that was being cast.
- Fixed a problem with the "Automatic Still" feat not working correctly with sub-radial spells (e.g. Shadow Conjuration).
- Fixed a problem with no longer being able to sit in a chair if you had previously destroyed an object while that object was still sitting in the chair.
- Red Dragon Disciple wings will now be properly removed on level down.
- The Cloud of Bewilderment scroll item now has the correct description.
- Added a new ini setting to nwnplayer.ini  [Game Options] ClientEntireChatWindowLogging=1 (Defaults to off). Turning this option on will cause all text in the in-game chat window to be logged to the log file (regardless of whether or not you have set certain chat messages to be filtered).
- Fixed a minor gui scroll bar issue.
- Fixed a problem where the new Day/Night music track wouldn't play if you used SetTime() to suddenly change the current time of day from Day to Night or from Night to Day.
- Fixed a problem where "Seamlessly looping" sound effects would not play again after being turned off during a Day/Night transition.
- Fixed some issues related to logging out of a multiplayer game while possessing a familiar.
- Fixed some memory leaks.
- Made some optimizations to the game's resource caching system.
- Made several game stability fixes.

DM Client:
=-=-=-=-=-
- Added ability for DMs to create items directly inside placeable containers (e.g. chests) using the creator. Choose the item to be created in the creator, and then target a placeable to have the item created directly inside the placeable.
- If you drag a "Create <thing>" item from the creator menu to your quickbar, it will now give you useful tooltips for all your DM Creator Quickbar buttons (this will NOT retroactively add the new tooltips to existing DM quickbar buttons). There are also new quickbar icons for the different major categories (i.e. placeables, items, triggers and encounters).
- DMs can now move undroppable items between a player's inventory and their own inventory and they can drop undroppable items now too.
- DMs can now use items on their quickbar while possessing creatures with full powers (i.e. if the item is in the DM's inventory, but not the creature's inventory).
- DMs can no longer force rest other DMs.
- DMs can no longer jump other DMs around.
- Fixed some issues with loading saved games that were saved while a DM was possessing a creature. This could lead to a number of different symptoms such as: DMs getting stuck inside creatures and not being able to unpossess them; DMs not being able to possess creatures that they should be able to possess; creatures disappearing entirely from the saved game; or the server crashing.
- Disabled the ability to polymorph while possessing a creature, since doing this would wreck your game.
- If a DM gave more gold to a player than the player could carry, the feedback message was indicating the wrong amount of gold gained.
- Fixed a bug where you sometimes couldn't drag items onto your quickbar anymore after DM possessing/unpossessing creatures.
- DMs no longer broadcast "DM uses <item>" messages to other players when using an item in their DM's inventory. If possessing a creature and using an item from the possessed creature's inventory, then a message will still be broadcast as usual stating "<creature name> uses <item>".
- Fixed a minor issue where you could hear the DM's footsteps for a few seconds after they disappeared.

- Fixed crashes caused by using the scripting commands GetFactionBestAC() and GetFactionWorstAC().

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BRAND YOUR MODULE AS 1.62 THEN DO NOT EDIT YOUR MODULE IN THE VERSION 1.62 TOOLSET.
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO 1.61, WE WILL HAVE A 1.62 TO 1.61 PATCH AVAILABLE.
- Added the Sea Hag to game resources.
- Added the Winter Sky skybox to game resources.
- Custom talk tables now work in multiplayer games. If you don't have the module's required "*.tlk" file in your "tlk" directory the module wont load and you will be given an error message telling you that the tlk file is missing. This behaviour is the same as for Hak Paks.
- Fixed up a few spells for various bugs: Elemental Shape, Improved Invisibility, and Crumble.
- Fixed a bug that was causing store purchasing restrictions messages to be displayed at inappropriate times.
- HotU: Fixed crash in the official campaign that could sometimes happen after talking to the Battle Herald if you had a summoned familiar present.

- Made a fix to the Server/Module details. They were showing up under the wrong headings in the server details page.
- Made some fixes to skyboxes for their display and their transitions.
- Creatures now drop out of stealth mode and lose invisibility effects when they die. Makes it a little easier to find the body for resurrection purposes.
- Fixed a bug that was capping the Experience Points granted for killing a creature to a maximum Creature Rating of 20.  You now get the proper experience points for killing creatures that have a CR above 20.
- Fixed bug that would occur if you were disconnected from a multiplayer game while in defensive stance. If you logged back into the server your character would never be able to move ever again.

- Fixed the text message when using cleave in a defensive stance.
- Fixed character select screen crash that would occur if you had a character with a custom character class in the list and you loaded a module that didn't support that custom character class. The unsupported class will be displayed as "Barbarian".

- Clicking OK in the sound options menu will now correctly save the selected sound provider selected in the Advanced Sound Options gui to the nwn.ini file. Rather than overriding it with the preferred sound provider, which could be different.
- Fixed a display issue with the Henchman stealth mode/spell mode radial menu options.
- Fixed the Zen Archery Feat so that it is now used for non-touch ranged attacks instead of just ranged touch attacks.
- There were a number of problems with the calculations to attack bonuses for Melee Touch Attacks. These have been fixed now.
- Made some fixes to prevent game/character hacking. Sorry, but we will never publically discuss specific changes to the game with regards to hacking the game.
- Made several game stability fixes.


DM Client:
=-=-=-=-=-
- Added a confirmation box to the DM "Jump All Players to Point" feature.
- DM spawned in Placeables now spawn in facing the DM, rather than always facing East.
- DMs can now attack things again.


Scripting-specific:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- The GetFacing() scripting command will now always return the angle rounded to the nearest degree. This fixes a problem where in some odd situations the returned value was off by more than 0.01 and causing comparison operations to fail and breaking some puzzles in HotU.
- Made some fixes to GetIsImmune() to address the various issues where Monks, Druids, Paladins, and Red Dragon Disciples that have various feats that give immunities to poisons and disease.
- Made a fix to GetHasSpell() where it was returning incorrect values for creatures that could cast the Cure/Inflict Wounds spells.
- Made a fix to the GetClassByPosition() scripting command, so that it now works with the new HotU prestige classes and CLASS_TYPE_OOZE.
- Made a fix to the CreateItemOnObject() scripting command. Now if the item created was merged into an existing stack of similar items CreateItemOnObject() will return the merged stack object rather than OBJECT_INVALID. If the merged stack overflowed, then CreateItemOnObject() will return the overflowed stack that was created. This also fixes a Scribe Scroll bug, where if you created a new scroll and you had an existing scroll in your inventory, it would state that you failed, but the scroll would be created anyways.
- Fixed an issue when calling SetCutsceneMode(FALSE) and it not clearing the player's plot flag.
- The SurrenderToEnemies() scripting command now removes wounding effects from the surrendering creature, so that you can talk to them.
- We now allow users to specify any Camera Traslation Speed.
- Made a fix to CreateObject() so that objects created are done from their templates so they can pick up template variables.
- The GetLastClosedBy() scripting command now works in the OnStoreClosed event of stores. The GetLastOpenedBy() scripting command should now be more reliable when used on stores in a multiplayer game.
- GetIsImmune() scripting command now also takes into account Palemaster's Tough as Bones feat, Paladin's aura of courage feat and Monks perfect self. Fixes some immunity text message feedback weirdness when Palemasters are being attacked by Gelatenous cubes and such.

Server-specific changes:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-

Neverwinter Nights Aurora Toolset:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- Fixed bug where ctrl + up arrow or ctrl + down arrow in the Sound Properties dialog's waves listbox would cause the selected item index to move twice in the indicated direction instead of once.
- Small stability fixes
- Fixed some memory leaks

Custom Content:
- Support for using an alternate tlk file if the StrRef is greater than 0x00ffffff, where the bit 0x01000000 has been set. It will mask off the upper 2 hex digits and use the resulting number as the StrRef into the alternate tlk file.
- Module Properties dialog Custom Content tabsheet contains setting for specifying a custom tlk file from among those in the user's tlk subfolder.
- Added Hak conflicts dialog. It is launched from the Custom Contents page of the module properties dialog.

- Added Cursed/Undroppable property to Items.
- Whips created in Item Wizard automatically have "Bonus Feat: Disarm (Whip)"
- Added support for stand-alone Visual Effect item property.
- Fixed bug where elemental damage vfx would not always override alignment damage vfx.

- Fixed bug in Item Properties dialog where no color variations would be listed for a weapon part if it has only one color variation.
- Gold can no longer be set to undroppable in the inventory dialog for creatures.
- When composing an armor icon, the appropriate armor parts are now hidden according to the settings in parts_robe.2da.

Creatures:
- Added Wings and Tails support.

- In Creature Properties dialog, entering a special ability caster level > 15 will clamp the value to 15 instead of restoring the previous value.
- Restrict maximum Special Ability caster level to 15.
- Fixed bug in Creature Dialog where visiting the Classes page would cause unspecified classes to count as 1 level toward the creature's total level when calculating HP. (eg., level 10 abberation would have 12 levels of constitution bonus).
- Fixed bug where a creature could be saved with a level 0 class.
- When loading a creature, it will no longer load classes that have -1 classID and/or level 0.
- Can no longer set a creature's level to 0 in the creature properties dialog.
- When loading package names in Creature Editor, fall back on 2da Label if StrRef not found.

Creature Wizard and Creature Levelup Wizard:
- Added new package-2da-based backend for Creature Wizard.

- Fixed bug in Creature Wizard where Starting Package was not being initialized.
- Changed Creature Wizard to use the CLS_BFEAT_*.2da tables to determine class bonus feats instead of hardcoding rules for each class. Fixes problem where no hardcoded rules were present for some classes and level ranges, causing creatures to miss out on bonus feats.

Areas:
- Added skybox property to Areas.
- Added area property for fog clip distance.
- Added reading of default skybox from environment.2da when setting up default area properties.
- Increased height of Area Wizard dialog so that all tilesets are visible without having to scroll the listbox.
- Fixed bug in tilegroup painting where it would not lock corners in the interior of a tilegroup that should have been locked.
When painting group tiles, tiles that belong to the group are locked (at the center) and those tiles can skip the template verification.
This change allows for 3x3 and larger groups that contain null tiles.

- Fixed bug where Location Adjustment dialog would not flag the area as modified.

- Fixed bug where the Strings section of the ERF header of a module was not being set to exactly the same set of strings as in the Module.ifo's Description CExoLocString.
- Optimized ERF file I/O. ERF import and export is faster now and uses less memory.
- Significantly sped up saving custom creature palettes by not doing a full creature load in order to get the CR and FactionID. Instead, it now specifically reads only those fields out of the utc. However, this means that the CR is no longer recalculated, so if anything happened to invalide the CR since the creature was last saved, the CR saved to the custom palette will still be invalid.
- Build Module Dialog:
   - Double-clicking an instance in the message listbox will also edit that instance in its property dialog, not just focus on the instance.
   - Double-clicking a journal-related message in the messages listbox will open the journal editor.
- Added OnPlayerEquipItem and OnPlayerUnEquipItem event to module properties.

Resource Management:

- Do a total reload of a custom palette if trying to add a blueprint whose palette category does not exist in the current custom palette, which could happen in old modules created prior to the addition of new standard palette categories.

Scripting:
- In Script Editor: when parsing shortcuts for a script, user-defined constants will now appear in bold in the Constants listbox. A user-defined constant must be "const int", "const float", or "const string" and have an assignment. eg., "const int BLAH = 0;"
- Fixed BadStrRef statusbar hint when mousing over main text entry area of script editor.
- Added context menu items for Location and Variables dialogs from the module contents treeview.
- Variables dialog:
  - Fixed Variables dialog not flagging the current area as modified when it was used on an instance.
  - Added Variables dialog menu option for Encounter and Trigger instances.
  - Replacing a Variable will no longer deselect it from the Variables listview. This will allow you to Replace it again without reselecting it.
  - After deleting a variable, it will select the next variable that moved into selected line, if there is one.
  - Fixed Delete button still being enabled when no variables are selected.

Doors:
- Invisible door models in doortypes.2da (VisibleModel = 0) now show up in the Unique Door Appearances dropdown in the Door Properties Dialog, regardless of what tileset the current area is using.
- Door Dialog now checks TileSet0, TileSet1, TileSet3 columns in doortypes.2da if the TileSet column does not match the currently open area's tileset. If one of those additional columns matches the current area's tileset, then that door appearance is selectable.
- Door Wizard now sets OnDeath=x2_door_death for new Doors.

Placeable Objects:
- Added Environment-mapping support for placeable objects by reading "Reflection" column from placeables.2da. **** means no reflection. "default" means use the default env map. Any other value means to use the named TGA file.

Sound:
- The Audio page of the Area Properties dialog will no longer show music tracks that do not exist.
- The Audio page of the Area Properties dialog will no longer show ambient sound tracks that do not exist.
- Fixed bug where the ambient sound dropdowns, on the Audio page of the Area Properties dialog, were not using the DisplayName column in ambientsound.2da when no StrRef was present in the Description column.

Conversation Editor:
- Fixed bug where the Text Dump function in the Conversation Editor function would not restore the toolset's original working folder after saving the text dump.
- removed Looping checkbox for animations in a conversation node. It never worked correctly, and making it would would require the artists to create two copies of every animation in the list--a fire and forget and a looping one.
- Added context menu option in area viewer to directly edit the conversation of an instance.

SpellCheck:
- Removed MS Word SpellCheck.

Journal:
- Fixed bug where recent changes to the LocName and Comments of a Journal Category would be discarded when R-clicking the treenode for that journal category.

Factions:
- Added progress bars to faction updates when OKing the Faction Editor.

Plot Wizard:
- Fixed bug in Plot Wizard where it would insert OnAcquireItem lines at the top of the Module OnAcquireItem script, if that script already existed, but did not contain any previous Plot Wizard modifications.
- Fixed bug in plot node wizard where a node that uses the designated villain cast member would always be loaded up with the "Conflict with Villain" radio button checked, even if it was saved with the "Conversation" button checked.

Multi-Language Support:
- Fixed toolset always using English as the user's language ID. It now uses the language in dialog.tlk
- Fixed LocString dialog, when initially showing itself, showing the first available embedded string if no string for the user's current language could be found.
- Fixed conversation dialog tree always displaying locstrings in English. It will now display in the current language
- Fixed bug where a LocString control would have its displayed text added to the locstring on initial creation when the displayed text is not for the current language.
- If a localized text control cannot find a string in the specified language and gender, it will search for a string in the specified language but opposite gender, before it searches for a strref or string in another language.
- After clicking OK in the multilanguage string dialog, the text in the LocString field would be set to the first available language's string. If the string shown was not for the current language, it would then change the current language's string to the displayed string. Fixed so that it no longer sets the text for the current language on returning from the multilanguage dialog.
- Added Default Editing Language option so that the user can set the default language for editing locstrings to something other than the language specified in the user's dialog.tlk file. Note that this only affects user-entered module text, not the actual GUI labels. (eg., an English user can edit a module as if he were German, with all localized strings showing up and being saved in German instead of English.)


DM Client:
=-=-=-=-=-
- Fixed HP sometimes displaying as 0/0 in DM party bar.
- DMs will now be included in Attack, Damage, and Death messages as if they were a member of the party

  SetStolenFlag()
  GetIsCreatureDisarmable()
  GetItemPropertyParam1Value()
  GetItemPropertyParam1()
  GetItemPropertyCostTableValue()
  GetItemPropertyCostTable()
  GetIsInSubArea()
  EffectCutsceneImmobilize() - this effect is meant for the Dwarven Defender's defensive stance. it roots the creature to the spot so that they can't move but grants no other penalties. It cannot be resisted (even by Freedom of Movement)
- We now drop items at the object's position when CopyItem() or CopyAndModifyItem() fails to add the new item to the inventory.
- Fix to CopyAndModifyItem() to not always drop the items at your feet
- Fixed a crash when an area attempted to do an ActionSpeakString()

Server-specific changes:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-
- Fixed a server crash when a creature that was the target of a spell was sent into limbo.
- Made some improvements to network performance.
- Made some fixes to prevent game/character hacking. Sorry, but we will never publically discuss specific changes to the game with regards to hacking the game.
- Made several game stability fixes.


Neverwinter Nights Aurora Toolset:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Added a new system for script caching on the game server. You can now cache your most frequently called scripts to help improve performance. Go to "Module Properties" and click on the new "Cached Scripts" tab.
- Added ability to save and load a set of spell selections on the Spells tab of Creatures. Uh, is this the coolest thing ever, or what?
- Added buttons on Scripts page of various object types to save an load a set of script assignments. Actually, this is pretty darn cool, too.
- Added Autolevelup Package dropdown to Classes tab for Creatures, for use when autolevelling up a creature via scripting.
- Changed representation of current area's treenode in the area treeview. Instead of being in bold text, it now uses the Script Editor's keyword color. Bold text was causing sizing issues with certain fonts, most notably in Japanese.
- When deleting temp0 folder, delete read-only files as well as files of types unknown to the resource manager. If the directory cannot be removed, show an error message.
- Added double-click support to Inventory dialog. Double-clicking a treeview item sends it to the backpack/store. Double-clicking a backpack item attempts to equip it. Double-clicking an equipped item unequips it.
- Added Cancel button to Build Module progress bar.
- Added warnings when editing a resource that is in a Hak Pak, and added option to enable/disable the resource-is-in-Hak-Pak warning.
- Fixed creation of temp directories for new modules so that they are called "temp0" instead of just "0".
- Changed handling of stray temp directories in the modules folder. Toolset will try to use only temp0, not any of the higher numbers. It will automatically remove a stale temp0 if temp0 is empty, and prompt to remove temp0 if it is not empty but contains no module.ifo to recover. It will now do the temp0 check on every attempt to create a new module or open an existing one.
- Added support in the Resource Selection dialog for "x#_" resref filters when the filter currently in use begins with "nw_" or "plc_".
- Modifications to current area now prompted for save when exporting the current area via File|Export. It had already been doing this when exporting via the area treeview's Export context menu option.
- Added Armor Class field to the Appearance tab for armor being edited in the Item properties dialog. This makes it easier to see the effect of armor appearance on AC. This is simply a duplicate of the one on the General page.
- Added Armor Check Penalty, Arcane Failure Rate, and Max Dex Bonus fields to Item properties dialog.
- Fixed bug in item dialog where Stack Size adjustments using the UpDown control would update the Total Cost field using the previous stack size value.
- Fixed bug in Store Dialog where the Sell Mark Up would increment when attempting to increase the Buy Mark Down past its maximum. The Sell Mark Up now remains the same.
- Inventory dialog for stores now consistent with game in terms of buy/sell values. Minimum buy/sell price is 1 gp at all times, except for plot items, which are always 0 gp buy/sell.
- Static Placeable objects forced to default animation, because that's the only animation the game supports for them.
- Fixed stack overflow bug when placeable object properties opens an object whose portrait ID has no value in portraits.2da.
- Open Lock and Close Lock DC now disabled when 'Key Required to Lock or Unlock' is checked.
- Fixed minor bug with Preview Window layout cutting off information for triggers.
- Fixed Preview Window not showing all information for Trigger and Store instances.
- Fixed problem where in non-English languages, the users would see English text in the custom palettes, even when the custom palette node's blueprint did have a StrRef for its name. Refreshing a palette will now use the StrRef for a blueprint IF the blueprint name has a StrRef, AND the blueprint name's locstring does not have any embedded text.
- Fixed bug where, if a module could not be opened, the toolset would say that required hak paks are missing even if there are no missing hak paks.
- Fixed inability to cut/copy/paste in the non-modal dialogs appearing over the main toolset window (eg., the Find Instances dialog).
- Fixed garbled characters in Store Setup Dialog when warning that the selected creature is of a hostile faction.
- Fixed creature and item colors not updating when choosing their colors in their property dialogs when environment mapping is turned off.
- Fixed memory leak in hak pak attachment in the module properties dialog.
- Fixed encounter spawn point orientations not saving correctly when they are facing between 0 and 180 degrees.
- Fixed OK button appearing on the generic warning dialog when it should not.
- Fixed bug where, when trying to remove all references to a script or conversation from the module, it would stop after the first such removal in each area in the module, leaving the other object instances untouched.
- Fixed bug where certain item types were being rotated about an incorrect axis when rotating them in the area viewer.
- Fixed access violations and allocated memory overwrite errors when doing the following exact set of steps: Ctrl-C an instance, Ctrl-V, then select a different palette or blueprint, then select another instance and Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V.
- Fixed bug where shrinking an area would not mark the area or module as modified.

Script Editor:
- Script Editor no longer parses #include files inside /* */-style block comments when generating the list of functions and variables in the sidebar
- In Script Editor, Ctrl+F now prompts to search again from the beginning if the string was not found, just like F3.
- Script Editor dialog remembers window state (maximized/normal)
- Fixes bug where Script Editor would fail to compile conditional scripts when doing a Save All with Autocompile-on-save turned on.
- Fixed bug where exporting a conditional script would sometimes not compile the script.

Conversation Editor:
- Added Insert Token button to Conversation Editor.
- Conversation Editor remembers position of splitter bars.
- Added Ctrl+F, Ctrl-R, and F3 shortcut keybindings to Conversation Editor.
- Fixed Conversation Test dialog's initial test node not showing all the text for a response that has long, multiline text.
- Fixed BadStrRef context menu item in the Conversation Dialog Input dialog. It now reads "Insert Token".
- Fixed bug in Conversation Editor where the [END DIALOGUE] indicator on a PC node (and all nodes linking to it) would not disappear after pasting an NPC node under it (either as a link or for real).

Journal Editor:
- Journal Editor no longer re-sorts the Entries within a Category unless the last edited Entry had its ID changed. This reduces the frequency with which the treeview will scroll to the right when moving among the treenodes (the scrolling was annoying).
- Journal Editor has vertical scrollbars in text entry fields now.

Plot Wizard:
- Changed Plot Wizard basic page to show blueprint full names instead of resrefs.
- When loading a plot blueprint, Plot Wizard no longer asks for confirmation to overwrite the current plot if the current plot has not been modified.
- Fixed progress frame sometimes not repainting when changing the status of a line or set of lines.
- Fixed progress frame having red X's for all steps when reopening a plot or an existing plot node. The steps are now marked with green checks to reflect that they had been completed already.
- localized plot overwrite confirmation when loading plot blueprint in plot wizard.

Patch details for 1.28:
Neverwinter Nights Game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
WARNING! AS OF THIS PATCH, ALL MODULES CREATED/SAVED WITH THE VERSION 1.28 TOOLSET ARE TAGGED AS REQUIRING VERSION 1.28 OR HIGHER OF NEVERWINTER NIGHTS GAME OR TOOLSET.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BRAND YOUR MODULE AS 1.28 THEN DO NOT EDIT YOUR MODULE IN THE VERSION 1.28 TOOLSET.
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO 1.27, WE WILL HAVE A 1.28 TO 1.27 PATCH AVAILABLE.

- Added Gnolls to the game resources.
- Added support for multiple Hak Paks.
- Added "unlockcamera 1" console command. This overrides min/max pitch and distance to allow distances from 1 - 25, and pitch from 1 - 89.
- Added custom tokens to the journal system. No, really. For sure this time.
- Added custom token support to placeables. If you add a custom token to a placeable name, then if that token is set when the area loads in, it will show up in the name of the placeable. (ie: Jail Cell can be changed to "Yoko's Jail Cell" when you re-enter an area once you've captured Yoko in the keep). This won't change for people already in the area.
- Fixed polymorph removal on all saving/exporting of creatures.
- Added new ATI code for the ATI Catalyst 3.0/3.1 drivers. Please upgrade to the ATI Catalyst 3.1 drivers if you have not done so already.
- Changed Ambient Music Day/Night transition fadeout time to 10 seconds.

- Fixed a feedback crash with Barbarian Rage in certain specific areas.
- Fixed "Damage Reduction absorbed # damage" message. It now displays the correct value absorbed for Barbarians/Monks.
- Changed resolution of FirstName and LastName tokens in conversations so that if a first name is required but isn't populated, it will use the last name instead and vice-versa. Note that this means if both a FirstName and a LastName token are used and only one name is given for the character, the name will appear twice in a conversation. But, you should be using <FullName> in that case anyway.
- If GameSpy is offline, Favorites, History, Buddy Lists, and Direct Connect will all be available from the Internet Multiplayer screen instead of denying access.

     //   int CAMERA_TRANSITION_TYPE_CRAWL = 2;
     //   int CAMERA_TRANSITION_TYPE_VERY_SLOW = 5;
     //   int CAMERA_TRANSITION_TYPE_SLOW = 20;
     //   int CAMERA_TRANSITION_TYPE_MEDIUM = 40;
     //   int CAMERA_TRANSITION_TYPE_FAST = 70;
     //   int CAMERA_TRANSITION_TYPE_VERY_FAST = 100;
- Added CopyObject() scripting command.
     // Duplicates the object specified by oSource.
     // ONLY creatures and items can be specified.
     // If an owner is specified and the object is an item, it will be put into their inventory
     // If the object is a creature, they will be created at the location.
     // If a new tag is specified, it will be assigned to the new object.
     object CopyObject(object oSource, location locLocation, object oOwner = OBJECT_INVALID, string sNewTag = "");

- Added server logging of connection attempts.
- Added server CDKey logging to "Player Name (XXXXXXXX) Joined as Player #" messages.
- We now load in the ban lists from the ini, when ever the ini file has changed. This should allow cross server banning when running multiple servers on the same box.


Neverwinter Nights Aurora Toolset:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Added multiple Hak Pak support.
- Improved module loading speed. However, this change means that you can no longer insert blueprints into a module outside of the Toolset by putting them in the module temp directory, and expect them to appear when you load the module.
- Added right-click menu option to manually reload any of the blueprint palettes. Useful if you inserted blueprints into a module outside of the toolset and they don't appear because of the new module loading code.
- Optimized loading of blueprint files during palette refresh after operations such as File|Import, or creating a new plot.

- Fixed a divide by zero script error with AutoDC checks from the Script Wizard.
- Recursive file includes in scripts no longer generates the same error message twice.
- Fixed a bug where parsing a script file with a circular include would cause the script text to change to the error text. The error text will correctly go into the Help pane now.

- Added custom scripting to plot node conversation nodes.


Hak Pak Editor:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Added File|Merge option to merge another Hak Pak into the one that is currently open. This will just merge the file content of the Hak Paks. This will NOT merge 2DA files.
- Added error reporting to the "Build Hak from directory" option of the Hak Pak editor, which is invoked with a command line of the form "nwhak.exe <newhakfile.hak> <directory_to_create_from>"
