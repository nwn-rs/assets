Installing Neverwinter Nights
-----------------------------

To install NEVERWINTER NIGHTS just insert the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS 
INSTALL DISK 1 into your CD-ROM drive and follow the on-screen 
prompts to install the game. 

If the AutoPlay screen does not automatically appear after inserting 
the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS CD Install Disk 1 into your CD-ROM drive, 
follow these steps:

1.	Close all running programs.
2.	Ensure that the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS CD Install Disk 1 
	is in your CD-ROM drive.
3.	Double-click My Computer on your desktop.
4.	Double-click the CD-ROM icon.
5.	Double-click on the Setup.exe icon to launch the installer.
6.	Follow the on-screen instructions to launch the game. 

Note: you do NOT need to install GameSpy Arcade to play Neverwinter Nights
on the Internet.

After installing the game, you will be offered the choice to view the readme 
or play the game. The readme is a text file, which lists additions to the 
manual since printing. 


Optimizing Gameplay
-------------------

The installer automatically detects the type of system you have and 
configures your option settings for optimal gameplay when you first install.  
You can adjust the option settings later but if you turn up your 
options this may cause slowdowns in gameplay if you are running
on less than a recommended system (see above under System Requirements).

Defragging harddrive makes saving the game much faster - we recommend you 
defrag your harddrive prior to installing and occasionally between 
play sessions. 

If you are experiencing slowdowns or poor performance, we recommend that 
you try turning down Options settings such as:
	
	(Video Options) Graphics quality
	(Video Options)	Creature shadow detail
	(Video Options)	Enable environment shadows
	(Video Advanced Options) Grass
	(Video Advanced Options) Creature wind
	(Video Advanced Options) Number of dynamic lights
	(Video Advanced Options) Shadow casting lights
	(Video Advanced Options) Anti aliasing
	(Video Advanced Options) Texture animations
	(Video Advanced Options) Environment mapping
	(Video Advanced Options) Visual effects high
		
Certain options such as shiny water, dynamic lighting, and anti aliasing 
may only be available on the recommended video cards and higher.

A recommended system will be able to play the game with most of 
the advanced options turned on while a minimum spec system may require 
some of these options to be turned off.

The Official Campaign
---------------------

The Prelude is designed as a purely single-player experience.

The rest of the official campaign (chapters 1, 1e, 2, 2e, 3 and 4) 
has been designed as primarily either a single-player or one-party 
multiplayer experience.

Modules you create using the toolset or download can of course be single-player, 
multi-player co-op/one-party, or multiplayer with multiple parties/PVP.

Before moving between any of the Chapters or End Chapters in our 
campaign, be aware that you can never go back to the previous chapter 
(to collect discarded equipment, or complete subplots).  
Take what you need before you leave a chapter!

The official campaign has been designed with the following level 
progression in mind:

	Prelude:   Levels  1 to  3
	Chapter 1: Levels  3 to  8
	Chapter 2: Levels  7 to 15
	Chapter 3: Levels 13 to 17
	Chapter 4: Levels 15+

The Official Campaign - Shadows of Undrentide
---------------------

This expansion pack was designed to be a purely single-player or one-party, 4 player multiplayer experience.
This mean that the leader of the party (Host, or first player to join) is 
considered the leader and will be the preferred character for quests and
NPC interactions.

Modules you create using the toolset or download can of course be single-player, 
multi-player co-op/one-party, or multiplayer with multiple parties/PVP.

Before moving between any of the Chapters or End Chapters in our 
campaign, be aware that you can never go back to the previous chapter 
(to collect discarded equipment, or complete subplots).  
Take what you need before you leave a chapter!

The official campaign has been designed with the following level 
progression in mind:

	Chapter 1: Levels  1 to  7
	Interlude: Levels  7 to 9	
	Chapter 2: Levels  9 to 13


The Official Campaign - Hordes of the UnderDark
---------------------

This expansion pack was designed to be a purely single-player experience and
was not balanced for a party of human players.  This means that some items 
may be lost forever if a player picks it up and then exits the game.  
This also means that some cutscenes will not appear for other players, 
but just for the party leader, even if it was another player that arrived 
at the place where the cut scene would play.

Modules you create using the toolset or download can of course be single-player, 
multi-player co-op/one-party, or multiplayer with multiple parties/PVP.

Before moving between any of the Chapters or End Chapters in our 
campaign, be aware that you can never go back to the previous chapter 
(to collect discarded equipment, or complete subplots).  
Take what you need before you leave a chapter!

The official campaign has been designed with the following level 
progression in mind:

	Chapter 1: Levels  15 to 18
	Chapter 2: Levels  18 to 22	
	Chapter 3: Levels  22 to 25


	
INSTRUCTION MANUAL
------------------

Included on this product's game disc is an electronic version of the game's 
Instruction Manual in .pdf format, Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.1 (which enables you to view the manual in .pdf format), 
and an Install Guide file explaining how to access and use these features. 
Please refer to the Install Guide file by clicking on the Start button on your Windows® 
taskbar and then selecting Programs > Neverwinter Nights > NWN PLAT Manual.pdf


Spell-caster Hints
-------------------
Spellcasters need to have high ability scores to cast high level spells.
The prime attributes for the various spell casting classes are as follows:

Wizard: Intelligence
Bard, Sorcerer: Charisma
Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Paladin: Wisdom

When you create your character and hit the Recommended button at the ability 
score page, you will be given an appropriate number of points in the prime abilities
for your chosen class.

The way the formula works is that the character can cast spells if their required
ability score is equal to or greater than 10 + the level of the spell.

For example, a wizard with only 10 intelligence could only cast cantrips 
(level 0 spells). A sorcerer with a 19 charisma could cast up to 9th level spells.


Extra Functionality
--------------------

TAB KEY: Pressing this button will highlight all objects in the visible area. 
Any creatures in this area will display their name and health above their heads.

TYR'S POOL OF LOST ITEMS: In chapter one there is a pool -- normally found 
in the main floor of Drogan's House.  This pool will contain a temple store, 
where for a small fee, players may purchase 'lost' items. These 'lost' items 
are items that have been taken away in a multiplayer game by players who have 
logged off, or which have been dropped elsewhere in the single player campaign. 
The items are marked as 'plot' and hence are necessary to complete the module.  
In this way, if you ever find that you have 'lost' a critical path or required 
quest item in either single player or multiplayer in the official campaign, 
you can obtain the missing item for a small fee from the pool.

DATE and TIME: IF you move the mouse over the compass it will tell you the month day 
and time currently in the game.

HENCHMEN INVENTORY:  By navigating through the Henchmen Radial menu, the player 
can now access their henchmen’s inventory.  The player can now equip their 
henchmen and upgrade their weapons, or give them healing potions.  Shopkeepers 
become confused if the player tries to sell or buy items from the Henchmen’s 
inventory.  It’s better if you move all items you wish to sell to your backpack 
then sell them to a merchant.
The types of weapon or item henchmen can use depend on the henchmen’s feats, 
just as the player.  Items the henchmen cannot use will be highlighted in red.  
However, if the player can use them they will not appear red until they are 
fully placed into the henchmen’s inventory.  In the same token items the 
Henchmen can use but the player cannot, will not appear red until they are 
placed into the player’s inventory.

Henchmen Tips
-------------------

You are able to train your henchmen to take different classes than the one they 
started with. Dorna is capable of being a cleric, and without any guidance from you, 
she will split her levels between rogue and cleric. Xanos will take a maximum of two 
levels of barbarian to compliment his sorcerer nature unless ordered otherwise. 
Deekin has the potential to gain levels as a rogue as well as his primary class of 
bard. However, you may talk to your henchmen and ask them to either focus on their 
primary class, or their secondary class instead of their default training behavior.

If you are a cleric you may want to take Dorna and ask her to never level up as a 
cleric, so that she can maximize her rogue skills. Likewise a rogue or spell-caster 
might find Xanos more useful as a barbarian. Deekin is very effective if the player 
has him take only one level of rogue for the sneak attack ability and then focus on 
the bard class exclusively after that point.

Also note that you can have the henchmen prepare themselves before battle by casting 
spells on themselves (or you). Just talk to them and explain what you want them to do.

Henchmen can be spoken to during the game to give them orders.  You can ask them to
cast spells, stand closer, help pick locks, or attack only when you do.

In addition, you can ask spellcasting henchmen to cast “buffing” spells.
“Buffing” spells are those which add a magical enhancement to the character. 
Some examples of “buffing spells” include:
Shield
Death Armor
Protection from Evil
Mind Blank
Bless
Invisibility
Clarity of mind
True seeing

If you ask your henchman to cast buffing spells, they will ask if you want 
them to cast short- term spells (which last for one combat), long-term spells 
(which last at least one game hour), or all their spells.

This may take a few rounds and if the player starts to run off 
while they are casting they will stop and follow the player.

The player can also ask each henchman to train in any or all of their 
different classes when leveling up. 
For example, Deekin the kobold is part bard and part dragon disciple. 
When you ask Deekin to train exclusively as a bard or as a dragon disciple, 
he will advance in the chosen class every time you level up. 
If you say nothing to them, they will level up according to their 
default configuration.

Sometimes, the henchmen may not seem that they are attacking.  
If you notice one or more of your henchmen standing around while there are bad guys to 
kill it may be because of these reasons:  
1- cannot see the enemy. Check the henchman’s character sheet to see if they have been blinded.
2- The enemy is invisible. You need to make the enemy visible with dispel magic or a magic item with True Seeing

When a henchman dies in the game the only way to bring them back is to use spells
like resurrection and raise dead.  We highly recommend carrying a few scrolls of each with you.

Henchmen Death
---------------------

From time to time your henchmen may die.  When this happens, they will fall prone 
and mention they need to be healed.  The player can use a spell, potion, or 
healing kit to bring the henchmen back to life.

During the Shadows of Undrentide campaign, sometimes the henchmen will panic 
and they will use their own rings to bring them back to Drogan’s house.  
At other times they may take enough damage to knock them unconscious, and 
will be removed from the party.  To get them back the player will need 
to heal them up fully and then talk to them and ask them to join again. 



Respawning
---------------

In the interlude and Chapter two of Shadows of Undrentide the player can no longer 
respawn as Drogan’s ring will not work at such great distance.  If a player dies 
in either of these two chapters they cannot select respawn to return to camp.  
Therefore it is highly recommended that the player save often.

In Hordes of the Underdark, when the player dies they are transported to the Realm of the Reaper.  
This happens because the player has an item called "The Relic of the Reaper" 
which has bound the player's soul to this realm. The relic works with orbs called "rogue stones"  
Everytime you choose to respawn you use up one rogue stone.  When you have run out of them, 
you can no longer respawn and you must reload a saved game.



Firewall Information
--------------------

If you are trying to connect to a Neverwinter Nights server through a 
firewall, NAT, or router, here is some information for you to help you get 
connected. First, please read the manual that came with your firewall or 
router.

Neverwinter Nights uses UDP, not TCP for its connections.

If you think that your firewall is preventing you from connecting to the 
game servers, please make sure that the following ports are open:

Ports 5120 through 5300

If you are wanting to make sure that your NAT is set up to allow the game 
to play here are some details:

Outgoing packets:
Source port: 5120-5129
Destination port: 5121-5300

Incoming packets:
Source port: 5121-5300
Destination port: 5120-5129

On the Game Client side, you can select what port your client uses. Go to 
your nwnplayer.ini file in your NWN Client Beta install directory. Find the 
following section:

[Profile]
Client Port=5120

Change this number if you need to force Neverwinter Nights to connect as a 
client on a different port.

Gamespy
-------

If you want to get a server listing via GameSpy, you’ll need additional 
ports to be open: 6667, 80, 27900, 28900, 29900, 29901, 13139, 6500



Banning and UnBanning in Multiplayer
------------------------------------

Please also see the Neverwinter Community webpage at nwn.bioware.com 
for more information on banning and unbanning.

When unbanning, you need to restart the server or the unbanning will not take effect.


If you accidentally ban someone and want to allow them back on your server,
don't panic, there's a simple fix. Find the nwnplayer.ini file and open it
with a text editor (notepad works well). Inside, you will find 3 headings:
	[Banned Ips]
	[Banned Players]
	[Banned CD Keys]

These represent the lists that any new server started on that machine will
use. If you want to clear them out, just delete the 3 headdings and
everything within them. If you know who you want to "unban" just remove
that specific IP, Player Name, or CD Key and make sure to renumber any
following entries so they're in order.

For example, given:
	[Banned Players]
	0=Trent
	1=Scott
	2=Paul
	3=Derek

If you want to unban Paul, but make sure that no evil Trent's, Scott's or
Derek's can get into your game, change it to the following:
	[Banned Players]
	0=Trent
	1=Scott
	2=Derek

As well, if you want to add a group of people to the banned list, there is
limited use of wildcards in two of the lists.

For IP's, you can enter partial starting IP's to ban entire domains:
	[Banned Ips]
	0=199.168.0.1
	1=199.168.1
	2=199.168
- these are all valid, as is
	3=199.168.2.*
and even
	4=199

For Player names, you have 2 wild cards, one at the start of the name and
one at the end of the name, both can be used simultaneously. For example:
	[Banned Players]
	0=Trent
	1=*Trent
	2=Trent*
	3=*Trent*

All of these are valid entries and will work as you would expect wildcards to work.
For example: "*Trent" will ban everyone with a "Trent" at the end of their name
- "Trent*" will ban everyone with a Trent at the start of their name
- and "*Trent*" will ban everyone with a "Trent" in their name at all
(don't add the quotes). The entries are case sensitive.


CD Key Troubles
---------------

If you are having problems with your CD Key, please contact Atari Support 
through the methods listed below under the Technical Support section of this readme.

Game Known Issues
-----------------

Please see the BioWare Neverwinter Community website (nwn.bioware.com) for 
a list of known compatibility issues, and work-arounds, if available. Also 
see the Atari Inc. support website (listed below, under the Technical 
Support section of this readme).

Hordes of the Underdark uses more visual effects and placeables than the 
original game used.  On lower end machines, this may cause some slowdowns 
in frame rate.  By reducing the graphic quality through the Video Options 
menu, the speed should return.

There is a known issue where henchmen sometimes do not switch from a 
ranged weapon like a bow or sling to a two-handed weapon.  If you notice 
your henchman doing this, open their inventory and switch their weapon manually.

In addition to the effects listed in-game, the Storm of Vengeance spell 
will also stun enemies that fail their reflex save

In the third chapter of Hordes the player is given a special ring that allows 
you to see in another dimension.  Rarely, the vision does not happen quickly.  
Removing the ring, then putting it back on again will fix this.

If you take a potion or any other usable item from a henchman and drag it to your inventroy, 
you would not be able to use it using the radian menu. 
closing and openning the inventory again would make the item usable.

There is a known issue where the game crashes to a black screen after choosing a character 
(or creating a new character) and clicking play.  One possible cause of this is if your 
computer has a corrupted "temp" folder in the Neverwinter Nights directory 
(or a file called "temp" with no file extension). 
Deleting or renaming the “temp” file/folder should fix the problem.

On Normal and Easy difficulty, the cure spells are always maximized.

The Ghostly Visage spell does not always make the player immune to 
area effect spells with duration, such as Entangle or Grease. Sometimes, 
if the player with Ghostly Visage stays in the affected area, there is a 
chance that those spells will actually affect them..

Sometimes a message will appear when trying to load a module. 
"Could not load the module. Could not unpack the module" 
One possible cause of this is if your computer has a 
corrupted "currentgame" folder in the Neverwinter 
Nights directory (or a file called "currentgame" with 
no file extension). 
Deleting or renaming the “currentgame” file/folder should fix the problem.

The game uses CD copy protection.  This type of protection occasionally has
incompatibility issues with certain CD and DVD drives.  If you are experiencing 
difficulties with launching the game post-install, try rebooting your computer and 
running the executable again.  This seems to work in the majority of cases.  

3dfx graphics cards are not supported. Although some Voodoo 5 cards may work 
with Neverwinter Nights, they are no longer supported by 3dfx and available 
drivers may not include the complete OpenGL support required by the game.

The game may show wrong shadow colors when playing on a GeForce FX with the current
Nvidia Forceware Drivers and the Image Quality settings moved toward "Performance" 
in the driver options menu. 
To correct this you should move the Image Quality Slider to "Quality" 
in order to get rid of this display problem

The movie player may not work properly under Windows 98 or Windows ME 
with certain video cards.  Updated drivers may help.

If you are having slow movie playback under Windows 98 or Windows ME 
you can edit the "SafeMovie=1" entry in your nwn.ini file to "SafeMovie=0". 
This will improve playback speed in-game but may introduce problems 
where the sound plays but the movie's visuals do not.  We mention this purely 
as an option for the advanced user.

The game may crash if you Alt-Tab while loading or saving a game.

The game window will not render properly if you attempt to play in a window 
while your desktop resolution is set to 800x600 or less.

The default video drivers provided with Windows XP do not have robust OpenGL 
support.  If you have Windows XP, upgrade your drivers as soon as possible.

Sounds may not play correctly or the game may crash under Windows XP 
if you are using the default drivers for the Creative Labs Soundblaster Live cards.  
Please upgrade your drivers as soon as possible.

GeForce 256 and the Nvidia drivers (43.45) have minor conflict issues with NeverWinter Nights, 
There may be some odd graphic corruption.

Neverwinter Nights was designed to run under 32-bit color depth.  
Running under other bit depths will reduce the performance of the game.

TVG - Video Card: SIS 315 and SIS 330 on both Windows ME and XP.
Consistently, when pressing the tilde key, the command prompt to enter Debug mode is not visible.
The "Memory Level=1" setting in the nwn.ini may have unintended consequences 
when set to values greater than 1.

At 1024x768 with ATI Radeon 7500 and below, frame rate is less than 20 fps.
At 1024x768 with Nvidia GeForce 2MX and GTS, frame rate is less than 20 fps.
Note: Graphics qualities adjustment was necessary to achieve desirable frame rate of 30 fps.
In Windows 9x, at 1024x768 and higher, adjusting the options with the mouse pointer is difficult.
The user must place the palm of the mouse pointer to adjust option.
All Nvidia GeForce2 chipsets and lower on all OS, adjusting the Overall Graphics 
Quality causes the game to crash to the desktop with an error.
SIS 315 and SIS 330, Adjusting the Set Resolution in the Video Options 
cause the game to crash to the desktop without error.

Shiny water:

In the video options menu, the player will see the option to enable "shiny water".  
On some video cards, this option is unavailable:

1. ATI Radeon 7500 and below,Nvidia GeForceDDR, GeForce 2, GeForce4 MX440, and QuadroPro2, 
Matrox Parhelia, Matrox G400, Matrox G450, and Matrox G550, SIS 315 and 330. 


Installing expansion packs
--------------------------

On Windows XP operating systems, The install program may encounter an unknown error when using a 
disk from a more recently published Neverwinter Nights expansion pack.  
(Installing expansion pack 2 then expansion pack one for example.)

This problem occurs on Windows XP systems with Windows Update 328310 installed. You must 
install Windows Update 814995 to correct this problem and then reinstall Neverwinter Nights and the expansion packs.


Known BioWare Aurora Neverwinter Toolset Issues
-----------------------------------------------

Check the BioWare Neverwinter Nights Community Website (nwn.bioware.com) for 
an in-depth tutorial and reference manual on the BioWare Aurora Neverwinter Toolset.

For design purposes, the level of compliance with the 3rd Edition D&D rules
differs between the game and the toolset.  This means that it is possible to
design creatures and items that exceed limits that the game may enforce.

Overriding TGA files via a Hak Pak may not have any visible effects,
because the texture packs use DDS files, which the graphics engine uses
in preference to TGA files. DDS is an internal proprietary compressed
texture format.

Certain tiles occasionally exhibit a strobing effect in the toolset - this is not 
visible in-game.

There is an issue with large volumes of text in Name, Description, and
similar fields being cut off (or potentially crashing the game). If you
stay under 1024 characters (approx. 200 words), it should be fine.

Changing the number of undo levels in the Tools->Options dialog doesn't
actually change the number of undo levels.  It is currently set to the
default of 32 levels of undo.

Flames for the tile source lights may not always be created (but can be placed 
manually).

If you have more then about a dozen or more 3D Sound objects placed in an
area, they may not all play due to there being a limited number of
available 3D voices. This number varies by Sound card, drivers, and
Sound Provider that you pick in the Game's Advanced Sound Options.

To force the nearest Sounds to play, if they're not already playing,
turn off playing of placed Sound objects and then turn it back on.

3D Sounds in the toolset are quieter relative to 2D Sounds than they
are in the game. Remember this when balancing Sound volumes. In general,
it's a good idea to test an area in game to make sure that it sounds
right.

Pressing the Ctrl key in the conversation editor may lead to an access
violation when editing multiple files.  You will still be able to save
your current conversations.  You will need to close down the conversation
editor and reopen it for it to function properly again however.
.


Creating Modules with original, or expansion pack game content only
------------------------------------------------
The platinum toolset has all the new Placeables, items, monsters, 
and tiles that are included in the three modules that make up the SoU campaign,
and the three modules that make up the HoTU campaign

Because of these additional tools, systems that do not have Shadows of Undrentide,
or Hordes of the Underdark installed cannot play a module built with the Hordes Aurora Neverwinter Toolset.

--------------------------

Atari, Inc., ("Atari, Inc.") AND BIOWARE CORP. ("BIOWARE") ARE WILLING 
TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE (as defined below) TO YOU ONLY ON THE CONDITION 
THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS IN THIS LICENSE (the "License") AND INDICATE 
YOUR ACCEPTANCE BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON.  PLEASE READ THE TERMS 
CAREFULLY BEFORE CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON.  BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" 
BUTTON, AND/OR BY LOADING OR RUNNING THE SOFTWARE, BY PLACING OR COPYING THE 
SOFTWARE ONTO YOUR COMPUTER HARD DRIVE, COMPUTER RAM OR OTHER STORAGE,  
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS LICENSE, UNDERSTAND IT AND AGREE 
TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 
DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE AND PROMPTLY RETURN THE DISC OR CARTRIDGE IN ITS 
ORIGINAL PACKAGING TO THE PLACE OF PURCHASE.

"Software" shall mean the game, toolkit, and all other software contained 
on this disc or cartridge, all updates and/or patches thereto, any accompanying 
documentation, all on-line components, restricted-access NEVERWINTER NIGHTS 
community websites, and other BioWare or Atari, Inc. game-related services 
(including all CD-authentication components).

1. Grant of License.  The Software is licensed to you, not sold, by Atari, Inc., 
and its use is subject to this License.  Atari, Inc. grants to you a 
limited, personal, non-exclusive right to use the Software in the manner 
described in the user documentation.  If the Software is configured 
for loading onto a hard drive, you may load the Software only onto 
the hard drive of a single machine and run the Software from only 
that hard drive.  You may permanently transfer all rights Atari, Inc. grants 
to you in this License, provided you retain no copies, you transfer all 
of the Software (including all component parts, the media and printed 
materials, the CD-authentication key, and any upgrades), and the recipient 
reads and accepts this License.  Atari, Inc. and BioWare reserve all 
rights not expressly granted to you by this License.

2. Restrictions.  Atari, Inc., BioWare, and/or their suppliers own the title, 
copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Software.  
The Software contains copyrighted material, trade secrets and other 
proprietary material.  You may not delete the copyright notices or any 
other proprietary legends on the original copy of the Software.  
You may not decompile, modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or 
otherwise reproduce the Software.  You may not copy, rent, lend, lease, 
sublicense, distribute, publicly display, create derivative works based 
upon the Software (except as provided in Section 3 below) or otherwise 
commercially exploit the Software (including, without limitation, 
hosting pay-per-play servers).  You may not electronically transmit the 
Software from one computer, console or other platform to another 
or over a network.

3. End-User Variations.  So long as you fully comply, at all times, 
with this License, Atari, Inc. grants to you a limited, personal, revocable, 
non-exclusive right to:   (i) use the Software's toolset feature to create 
your own NEVERWINTER NIGHTS modules ("Modules"), and (ii) create your 
own modifications to work with the Software (e.g., custom data files not 
created using the toolset) (the "User Conversions", and together with the 
Modules, the "Variations").  Your rights to create Variations are subject 
to the following restrictions:  (1) your Variations must only work with 
the full commercial version of the software game NEVERWINTER NIGHTS; 
(2) your Variations must not contain modifications to any executable file; 
(3) your Variations must not contain any libelous, defamatory, pornographic, 
obscene, or other illegal material, material that is scandalous or 
invades the rights of privacy or publicity of any third party, or 
contain any trademarks, copyright-protected work or other property of 
third parties, or contain any viruses, worms, or other malicious code; 
and (4) you may not rent, sell, lease, lend, offer on a pay-per-play or 
timesharing basis or otherwise commercially exploit or commercially distribute 
your Variations (including, without limitation, hosting pay-per-play servers, 
hosting pay-per-download web-sites for Variations including sites that charge 
for bandwidth use, and independently selling Variations online, at retail, 
mail order, etc.).  Without limiting the foregoing, you expressly acknowledge 
and agree that in no event shall you have the right or license to make any 
modification (whether using the toolkit or otherwise) to any portion of 
the Software for the purpose of creating any data file, executable, 
or other derivative work  that is intended to operate in a stand-alone mode, 
with any pre-release or beta version of NEVERWINTER NIGHTS, or any software 
program other than NEVERWINTER NIGHTS.

4.  Distribution and Serving of Modules and User Conversions.  So long as you 
fully comply at all times with this License, Atari, Inc. grants to you the 
limited, personal, revocable, non-exclusive right to:  (i) distribute your 
Modules or User Conversions by means of providing a copy of the actual Module 
or User Conversion code to other users (e.g., via ftp, email, disc copies, etc.) 
(collectively "Distribute"); and (ii) to allow other users to play your Modules 
by means of hosting your own NEVERWINTER NIGHTS server whereby you retain 
sole possession of your Module (collectively "Serve") (Serving User 
Conversions is not possible).

5.  Atari, Inc.' and BioWare's Use of Variations.  If you Distribute, or 
permit others to Distribute, your Variations,  you hereby grant back to 
Atari, Inc. and BioWare an irrevocable royalty-free right to use and 
distribute such Variations by any means, and to make such modifications 
thereto as Atari, Inc. and/or BioWare deem are necessary to package, 
combine, and otherwise distribute such Variations.  If you do not wish 
to grant these rights to Atari, Inc. and BioWare, you must not Distribute 
your Variations (although you may Serve your Modules).  Atari, Inc. and 
BioWare will make a reasonable effort to provide credit to you in the 
event it uses or distributes your Variations, but you acknowledge that 
identifying you and/or other Variation creators may be difficult, and 
any failure by Atari, Inc. and/or BioWare to provide credit to any person 
shall not be a breach of this License and shall not limit Atari, Inc.' or 
BioWare's rights to use and distribute any Variation.  

6.  Revocation of Rights.  Atari, Inc. and/or BioWare may at any time and in 
their sole discretion revoke your right to make your Variations publicly 
available (whether you are Distributing or Serving), provided that Atari, Inc. 
and/or BioWare shall not revoke your right to Distribute a Variation 
if Atari, Inc. and/or BioWare is, at the time of such revocation, using 
or distributing such Variation.

7. Termination.  This License is perpetual and may not be terminated except 
by mutual written agreement of the parties hereto.  However, your rights to 
use the Software, as set forth above: (i) may be terminated by you at any time, 
by destroying the Software; or (ii)  will terminate immediately without notice 
from Atari, Inc. or BioWare if you fail to comply with any provision of 
this License (in which event, you must destroy the Software).

8. Disclaimer of Warranty on Software.  You are aware and agree that use 
of the Software and the media on which it is recorded is at your sole risk.  
The Software and the media are provided "AS IS."  Unless otherwise provided 
by applicable law, Atari, Inc. warrants to the original purchaser of this product 
that the Software storage medium will be free from defects of materials 
and workmanship for ninety (90) days from the date of purchase.  
This warranty is void if the defect has arisen through accident, abuse, 
neglect or misapplication.

9.  Disclaimer of Other User Conduct and Gameplay Risks.  You agree 
and acknowledge that an integral feature of NEVERWINTER NIGHTS is 
the ability to play online with other game users, including playing 
Variations created by other users.  Atari, Inc. and BioWare specifically 
disclaim any warranties relating in any way to such user-created content, 
and you agree that neither Atari, Inc., BioWare, their assignees or successors, 
nor any of their licensors or suppliers shall in any way be responsible 
for the content or functionality of such user content.  You further 
agree and acknowledge that while playing multi-player games, you may be 
subject to conduct of other users that may impact your own gameplay 
and characters, or that you may find objectionable or offensive.  
Atari, Inc. and BioWare also specifically disclaim any warranties relating 
to the conduct of other users (including in-game, and in game-related forums, 
chatrooms, etc.), and you agree that neither Atari, Inc., BioWare, 
their assignees or successors,  nor any of their licensors or suppliers 
shall in any way be responsible for the conduct of other users.

10.  Disclaimer of Other Content.  As a service to you, Atari, Inc. and BioWare 
may include with the Software third party drivers and other software 
utilities intended to assist you with installing and operating the Software 
(collectively, the "Drivers").  Atari, Inc. and BioWare specifically disclaim 
any warranties relating to the Drivers, and you agree that your use of 
the Drivers is at your own risk.  The Drivers are not part of the Software 
and shall not be governed by the terms and conditions of this License 
except for and to the extent of this disclaimer.  

11.  General Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, 
Atari, Inc. AND BIOWARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  
NEITHER Atari, Inc. NOR BIOWARE WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED 
IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN 
INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Atari, Inc., BIOWARE OR ANY Atari, Inc. 
OR BIOWARE-AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY 
INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW

IN NO EVENT SHALL Atari, Inc.' OR BIOWARE'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR 
ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT 
OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.  
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF 
LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE 
LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

13.  Indemnity; Injunctive Relief.  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold 
harmless Atari, Inc., BioWare, and each of their respective officers, 
employees, directors, agents, licensees (excluding you), successors 
and assigns from and against all losses, lawsuits, damages, causes 
of action and claims relating to and/or arising from your breach 
of this License, distribution or any use of any Variations, and/or 
any other use of the Software.  You agree that your unauthorized use 
of the Software, or any part thereof, may immediately and irreparably 
damage Atari, Inc., BioWare, or both of them such that neither Atari, Inc. 
nor BioWare could be adequately compensated solely by a monetary award 
and that at Atari, Inc.' or BioWare's option, Atari, Inc. and/or BioWare 
shall be entitled to an injunctive order, in addition to all other 
available remedies including a monetary award, appropriately restraining 
and/or prohibiting such unauthorized use without the necessity of Atari, Inc. 
or BioWare posting bond or other security.  Your obligations set forth 
in this Section shall survive the cancellation or termination of this License.

AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTROLLING U.S. FEDERAL LAW AND THE LAWS

from Atari, Inc.' or BioWare's remedies at law for any violation of this 
License or applicable law.  If any provision of this License is unenforceable, 
the rest of it shall remain in effect. This License constitutes the entire 
agreement between you, Atari, Inc., and BioWare with respect to the use 
of the Software and the support services (if any) and supersedes all prior 
or contemporaneous oral or written communications and representations with 
respect to the Software or any other subject matter covered by this License.
