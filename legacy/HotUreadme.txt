Installing Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark
-----------------------------

To install NEVERWINTER NIGHTS: Hordes of the Underdark just insert
the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS: Hordes of the Underdark
INSTALL DISK 1 into your CD-ROM drive and follow the on-screen 
prompts to install the game. 

If the AutoPlay screen does not automatically appear after inserting 
the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS: Hordes of the Underdark CD Install Disk 1 into
your CD-ROM drive, follow these steps:

1.	Close all running programs.
2.	Ensure that the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS: Hordes of the Underdark
	CD Install Disk 1 is in your CD-ROM drive.
3.	Double-click My Computer on your desktop.
4.	Double-click the CD-ROM icon.
5.	Double-click on the Setup.exe icon to launch the installer.
6.	Follow the on-screen instructions to launch the game. 

Note: you do NOT need to install GameSpy Arcade to play Neverwinter Nights
on the Internet.

After installing the game, you will be offered the choice to view the readme 
or play the game. The readme is a text file, which lists additions to the 
manual since printing. 

***There is a known issue when the first Neverwinter Nights expansion pack 
Shadows of Undrentide, is installed after Hordes of the Underdark is installed 
On Windows XP systems.  The install will fail after the install asks for the
Hordes of the Underdark disc to be re-inserted.

This issue can be fixed by running the critical rebuild from the Shadows of Undrentide
Disc, then reinstalling Hordes of the Underdark.

This issue can also be fixed with the 9623_WXP_SP2_x86_ENU.exe avalible from Microsoft 
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=329623***

Note Regarding Creating a Multiplayer Account In Game
--------------------------------

When you create an account in game through the multiplayer menu, 
you are prompted for your email address.  If you would like to 
know what is done with the collected information, you should review 
our privacy policy at 
http://nwn.bioware.com/privacy.html  



Optimizing Gameplay
-------------------

The installer automatically detects the type of system you have and 
configures your option settings for optimal gameplay when you first install.  
You can adjust the option settings later but if you turn up your 
options this may cause slowdowns in gameplay if you are running
on less than a recommended system (see above under System Requirements).

Defragging harddrive makes saving the game much faster - we recommend you 
defrag your harddrive prior to installing and occasionally between 
play sessions. 

If you are experiencing slowdowns or poor performance, we recommend that 
you try turning down Options settings such as:
	
	(Video Options) Graphics quality
	(Video Options)	Creature shadow detail
	(Video Options)	Enable environment shadows
	(Video Advanced Options) Grass
	(Video Advanced Options) Creature wind
	(Video Advanced Options) Number of dynamic lights
	(Video Advanced Options) Shadow casting lights
	(Video Advanced Options) Anti aliasing
	(Video Advanced Options) Texture animations
	(Video Advanced Options) Environment mapping
	(Video Advanced Options) Visual effects high

	
Certain options such as shiny water, dynamic lighting, and anti aliasing 
may only be available on the recommended video cards and higher.

Note: in order to enable Shiny water you must have a GeForce 3 
or better video card.

A recommended system will be able to play the game with most of 
the advanced options turned on while a minimum spec system may require 
some of these options to be turned off.

Turning off Skyboxes should also increase performance.


The Official Campaign
---------------------

This expansion pack was designed to be a purely single-player experience and
was not balanced for a party of human players.  This means that some items 
may be lost forever if a player picks it up and then exits the game.  
This also means that some cutscenes will not appear for other players, 
but just for the party leader, even if it was another player that arrived 
at the place where the cut scene would play.

Modules you create using the toolset or download can of course be single-player, 
multi-player co-op/one-party, or multiplayer with multiple parties/PVP.

Before moving between any of the Chapters or End Chapters in our 
campaign, be aware that you can never go back to the previous chapter 
(to collect discarded equipment, or complete subplots).  
Take what you need before you leave a chapter!

The official campaign has been designed with the following level 
progression in mind:

	Chapter 1: Levels  15 to 18
	Chapter 2: Levels  18 to 22	
	Chapter 3: Levels  22 to 25

	
INSTRUCTION MANUAL
------------------

INSTRUCTION MANUAL
Included on this product's game disc is an electronic version of the game's 
Instruction Manual in .pdf format, Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.1 (which enables 
you to view the manual in .pdf format), and an Install Guide file explaining
how to access and use these features. Please refer to the Install Guide file 
by clicking on the Start button on your Windows® taskbar and then
selecting Programs > Neverwinter Nights > NWN Hordes Install Guide.

On Page 52 The description for the Automatic Still Spell feat says 
it requires 24 ranks of Spellcraft, but it actually requires 27.

On Page 13 of the original manual it says that right clicking an action 
will remove it from the queue.  It actually requires a left click.

Concentration and Parry are NOT cross-class skills for Dwarven Defender

On p.15 it suggests that a Barbarian can make a powerful Dwarven Defender, 
however Barbarians must be non-lawful, yet Dwarven Defenders are required to be lawful.

It is highly recommended that if you take a Weapon Master class, you make sure
you take the weapon of choice feat, otherwise the Ki Damage cannot be fully used.


Spellcaster Hints
-------------------
Spellcasters need to have high ability scores to cast high level spells.
The prime attributes for the various spell casting classes are as follows:

Wizard: Intelligence
Bard, Sorcerer: Charisma
Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Paladin: Wisdom

When you create your character and hit the Recommended button at the ability 
score page, you will be given an appropriate number of points in the prime abilities
for your chosen class.

The way the formula works is that the character can cast spells if their required
ability score is equal to or greater than 10 + the level of the spell.

For example, a wizard with only 10 intelligence could only cast cantrips 
(level 0 spells). A sorcerer with a 19 charisma could cast up to 9th level spells.


Extra Functionality
--------------------

Hordes of the Underdark introduces new camera functionality.  The camera can be 
zoomed very close to the player.  We recommend that if you play with the camera 
this close use the chase mode of the camera by pressing the “asterix” key on the number pad.  

- Prepare to tilt the camera up so the character can pick up objects and open chests 
- when they are at their feet.
- If the player cannot select an object or another character because you are 
  in the way, slide the camera over to one side or tilt it up to get an unblocked view.
- When the player is in combat, they will turn very quickly to fight the next opponent.  
  The camera will not track this movement as it can become very disorienting.  
  However, once the combat is over the camera will chase the player once again. 
- The camera can still be rotated while in this mode so the player can look around.  
  It will not snap back behind the player right away after moving it.
  It will snap behind the character, if they pause (or stop) for a second 
  and then start to move again.  

on Normal and Easy difficulty, the cure spells are always maximized and will 
heal the most hit points possible at higher difficulty these spells will 
heal a random amount of Hit points according to the spell description.

TAB KEY: Pressing this button will highlight all objects in the visible area. 
Any creatures in this area will display their name and health above their heads.

THE POOL OF LOST SOULS

THE POOL OF LOST SOULS is where lost plot items can be recoved.  In The original 
game and SHADOWS OF UNDRENTIDE this was called the DIVINING POOL 
THE POOL OF LOST SOULS is located in the realm of the reaper.  To access it 
you will need to use a rogue stone.  However, we have designed the game so that 
plot critical items should not be dropped or lost.


DATE and TIME: If you move the mouse over the compass it will tell you the month, day 
and time currently in the game.

HENCHMAN'S INVENTORY:  By navigating through the henchmen radial menu, the player 
can now access their HENCHMAN'S INVENTORY.  The player can now equip their 
henchmen and upgrade their weapons, or give them healing potions.  
Shopkeepers become confused if the player tries to sell or buy items from 
the HENCHMAN'S INVENTORY.  
It is better if you move all items you wish to sell to your 
backpack then sell them to a merchant.  The types of weapon or item henchmen 
can use depend on the henchmen’s feats, just as the player.  
Items the henchman cannot use will be highlighted in red when placed into the
 henchman’s inventory. Conversely, items the henchman can use but the player 
cannot will be highlighted in white in the henchman’s inventory but red when 
placed in the player’s inventory


Tips on Using Henchmen
-------------------

Henchmen can be spoken to during the game to give them orders.  You can ask them to
cast spells, stand closer, help pick locks, or attack only when you do.

In addition, you can ask spellcasting henchmen to cast “buffing” spells.
“Buffing” spells are those which add a magical enhancement to the character. 
Some examples of “buffing spells” include:
Shield
Death Armor
Protection from Evil
Mind Blank
Bless
Invisibility
Clarity of mind
True seeing

If you ask your henchman to cast buffing spells, they will ask if you want 
them to cast short- term spells (which last for one combat), long-term spells 
(which last at least one game hour), or all their spells.

This may take a few rounds and if the player starts to run off 
while they are casting they will stop and follow the player.

The player can also ask each henchman to train in any or all of their 
different classes when leveling up. 
For example, Deekin the kobold is part bard and part dragon disciple. 
When you ask Deekin to train exclusively as a bard or as a dragon disciple, 
he will advance in the chosen class every time you level up. 
If you say nothing to them, they will level up according to their 
default configuration.

Sometimes, the henchmen may not seem that they are attacking.  
If you notice one or more of your henchmen standing around while there are bad guys to 
kill it may be because of these reasons:  
1- cannot see the enemy. Check the henchman’s character sheet to see if they have been blinded.
2- The enemy is invisible. You need to make the enemy visible with dispel magic or a magic item with True Seeing

When a henchman dies in the game the only way to bring them back is to use spells
like resurrection and raise dead.  We highly recommend carrying a few scrolls of each with you.


Respawning
---------------
In Hordes of the Underdark, when the player dies they are transported to the Realm of the Reaper.  
This happens because the player has an item called "The Relic of the Reaper" 
which has bound the player's soul to this realm. The relic works with orbs called "rogue stones"  
Everytime you choose to respawn you use up one rogue stone.  When you have run out of them, 
you can no longer respawn and you must reload a saved game.


General Multiplayer Info
------------------------

Hordes of the Underdark was designed to be a single player experience.  
Playing with a party of 2 or more human players is not recommended.


CD Key Troubles
---------------

If you are having problems with your CD Key, please contact Atari Support 
through the methods listed under the Technical Support section of this readme.


Game Known Issues
-----------------

Please see the BioWare Neverwinter Community website (nwn.bioware.com) for 
a list of known compatibility issues, and work-arounds, if available. Also 
see the Atari Inc. support website (listed below, under the Technical 
Support section of this readme).

Hordes of the Underdark uses more visual effects and placeables than the 
original game used.  On lower end machines, this may cause some slowdowns 
in frame rate.  By reducing the graphic quality through the Video Options 
menu, the speed should return.

There is a known issue where henchmen sometimes do not switch from a 
ranged weapon like a bow or sling to a two-handed weapon.  If you notice 
your henchman doing this, open their inventory and switch their weapon manually.

In addition to the effects listed in-game, the Storm of Vengeance spell 
will also stun enemies that fail their reflex save

In the third chapter of Hordes the player is given a special ring that allows 
you to see in another dimension.  Rarely, the vision does not happen quickly.  
Removing the ring, then putting it back on again will fix this.

If you take a potion or any other usable item from a henchman and drag it to your inventroy, 
you would not be able to use it using the radian menu. 
closing and openning the inventory again would make the item usable.

There is a known issue where the game crashes to a black screen after choosing a character 
(or creating a new character) and clicking play.  One possible cause of this is if your 
computer has a corrupted "temp" folder in the Neverwinter Nights directory 
(or a file called "temp" with no file extension). 
Deleting or renaming the “temp” file/folder should fix the problem.

On Normal and Easy difficulty, the cure spells are always maximized.

The Ghostly Visage spell does not always make the player immune to 
area effect spells with duration, such as Entangle or Grease. Sometimes, 
if the player with Ghostly Visage stays in the affected area, there is a 
chance that those spells will actually affect them..

Sometimes a message will appear when trying to load a module. 
"Could not load the module. Could not unpack the module" 
One possible cause of this is if your computer has a 
corrupted "currentgame" folder in the Neverwinter 
Nights directory (or a file called "currentgame" with 
no file extension). 
Deleting or renaming the “currentgame” file/folder should fix the problem.

The game uses CD copy protection.  This type of protection occasionally has
incompatibility issues with certain CD and DVD drives.  If you are experiencing 
difficulties with launching the game post-install, try rebooting your computer and 
running the executable again.  This seems to work in the majority of cases.  

3dfx graphics cards are not supported. Although some Voodoo 5 cards may work 
with Neverwinter Nights, they are no longer supported by 3dfx and available 
drivers may not include the complete OpenGL support required by the game.

The game may show wrong shadow colors when playing on a GeForce FX with the current
Nvidia Forceware Drivers and the Image Quality settings moved toward "Performance" 
in the driver options menu. 
To correct this you should move the Image Quality Slider to "Quality" 
in order to get rid of this display problem

The movie player may not work properly under Windows 98 or Windows ME 
with certain video cards.  Updated drivers may help.

If you are having slow movie playback under Windows 98 or Windows ME 
you can edit the "SafeMovie=1" entry in your nwn.ini file to "SafeMovie=0". 
This will improve playback speed in-game but may introduce problems 
where the sound plays but the movie's visuals do not.  We mention this purely 
as an option for the advanced user.

The game may crash if you Alt-Tab while loading or saving a game.

The game window will not render properly if you attempt to play in a window 
while your desktop resolution is set to 800x600 or less.

The default video drivers provided with Windows XP do not have robust OpenGL 
support.  If you have Windows XP, upgrade your drivers as soon as possible.

Sounds may not play correctly or the game may crash under Windows XP 
if you are using the default drivers for the Creative Labs Soundblaster Live cards.  
Please upgrade your drivers as soon as possible.

GeForce 256 and the Nvidia drivers (43.45) have minor conflict issues with NeverWinter Nights, 
There may be some odd graphic corruption.

Neverwinter Nights was designed to run under 32-bit color depth.  
Running under other bit depths will reduce the performance of the game.

TVG - Video Card: SIS 315 and SIS 330 on both Windows ME and XP.
Consistently, when pressing the tilde key, the command prompt to enter Debug mode is not visible.
The "Memory Level=1" setting in the nwn.ini may have unintended consequences 
when set to values greater than 1.

At 1024x768 with ATI Radeon 7500 and below, frame rate is less than 20 fps.
At 1024x768 with Nvidia GeForce 2MX and GTS, frame rate is less than 20 fps.
Note: Graphics qualities adjustment was necessary to achieve desirable frame rate of 30 fps.
In Windows 9x, at 1024x768 and higher, adjusting the options with the mouse pointer is difficult.
The user must place the palm of the mouse pointer to adjust option.
All Nvidia GeForce2 chipsets and lower on all OS, adjusting the Overall Graphics 
Quality causes the game to crash to the desktop with an error.
SIS 315 and SIS 330, Adjusting the Set Resolution in the Video Options 
cause the game to crash to the desktop without error.

Shiny water:

In the video options menu, the player will see the option to enable "shiny water".  
On some video cards, this option is unavailable:

1. ATI Radeon 7500 and below,Nvidia GeForceDDR, GeForce 2, GeForce4 MX440, and QuadroPro2, 
Matrox Parhelia, Matrox G400, Matrox G450, and Matrox G550, SIS 315 and 330. 


Installing expansion packs
--------------------------

On Windows XP operating systems, The install program may encounter an unknown error 
when using a disk from a more recently published Neverwinter Nights expansion pack.  
(Installing expansion pack 2 then expansion pack one for example.)

This problem occurs on Windows XP systems with Windows Update 328310 installed. 
You must install Windows Update 814995 to correct this problem and then reinstall 
Neverwinter Nights and the expansion packs.


Known BioWare Aurora Neverwinter Toolset Issues
-----------------------------------------------

Check the BioWare Neverwinter Nights Community Website (nwn.bioware.com) for 
an in-depth tutorial and reference manual on the BioWare Aurora Neverwinter Toolset.

For design purposes, the level of compliance with the 3rd Edition D&D rules
differs between the game and the toolset.  This means that it is possible to
design creatures and items that exceed limits that the game may enforce.

Overriding TGA files via a Hak Pak may not have any visible effects,
because the texture packs use DDS files, which the graphics engine uses
in preference to TGA files. DDS is an internal proprietary compressed
texture format.

Certain tiles occasionally exhibit a strobing effect in the toolset - this is not 
visible in-game.

There is an issue with large volumes of text in Name, Description, and
similar fields being cut off (or potentially crashing the game). If you
stay under 1024 characters (approx. 200 words), it should be fine.

Changing the number of undo levels in the Tools->Options dialog doesn't
actually change the number of undo levels.  It is currently set to the
default of 32 levels of undo.

Flames for the tile source lights may not always be created (but can be placed 
manually).

If you have more then about a dozen or more 3D Sound objects placed in an
area, they may not all play due to there being a limited number of
available 3D voices. This number varies by Sound card, drivers, and
Sound Provider that you pick in the Game's Advanced Sound Options.

To force the nearest Sounds to play, if they're not already playing,
turn off playing of placed Sound objects and then turn it back on.

3D Sounds in the toolset are quieter relative to 2D Sounds than they
are in the game. Remember this when balancing Sound volumes. In general,
it's a good idea to test an area in game to make sure that it sounds
right.

Pressing the Ctrl key in the conversation editor may lead to an access
violation when editing multiple files.  You will still be able to save
your current conversations.  You will need to close down the conversation
editor and reopen it for it to function properly again however.


Creating Modules with original game content only
------------------------------------------------
The Hordes of the Underdark toolset has all the new Placeables, items, monsters, 
and tiles that are included in the three modules that make up the HotU campaign.

Because of these additional tools, systems that do not have Hordes of the Underdark 
installed cannot play a module built with the HoU Aurora Neverwinter Toolset.
