Client Changes
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Features:

* Three new player-selectable portraits; Heavyline, Skandii, and Lanteri.
* GOG Galaxy Overlay and game language selection support.

Fixes:

* We fixed certain armour pads (specifically, belts and shoulder pads) disappearing when re-equipping a item.
* We fixed a floating point inaccuracy that made the player character skew aside ever so slightly when WASDing.
* The conversation UI has been fixed to not shift off screen when using UI scaling and having the Inventory/Char sheet open at the same time.
* We fixed a double-free in the PLT system, which has lead to crashes when multiple objects with the same texture would show.
* We fixed held equipment not becoming transparent when the character model did so (for example, when casting Invisibility.)
* The game now asks you for a CD key, instead of erroring with a confusing message, when Steam CD key retrieval fails for any reason.
* HW Mouse is now the default on Linux, as to avoid WindowManager-related mouse click point offset issues resulting from UI scaling.
* We made all DLC portraits now show up for character creation in all modules, regardless of portrait.2da entries.

Content Creation Changes

Features:

* Toolset: The script editor now shows variables and constant declarations on double click.
* Toolset: The recent modules list has been expanded to 10 entries.
* Toolset: The compiler include limit has been bumped to 128.

Fixes:

* Toolset: Area ambient sounds and music has been brought back to life.
* Toolset: We removed the requirement that the mouse be over an object to translate it on the Z-axis (with Alt+Left Mouse Button).
* Toolset: The tile properties light select color UI is no longer truncated when using windows-native screen scaling.

Server Changes
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Fixes:

* Server resource management on Linux in certain memory configurations has been fixed.
* Crashes in nwscript functions resulting from bad parameters have been addressed: CopyItemAndModify, GetNearestCreatureToLocation
* A crash when reloading LTRs was fixed.
* Linux only: Database names are now case-insensitive, so DestroyCampaignDatabase() now works as expected.
* Linux/Mac only: We fixed the server spinning a thread needlessly if stdin gets closed.
